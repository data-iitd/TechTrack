How often do they pay? This can be a big deciding factor when choosing the appropriate site that you wish to work for. Some cam sites pay their models once a month, others once a week. What works best for you?

2 - What is their payment percentage?
What is their payment percentage? What this means is basically, what percentage of what you make is actually put into your pocket? Some companies pay 30%-35% and others pay all the way to 70%! This is something that can sometimes be easily overlooked and can make a BIG difference in your paycheck.

3 - What models are accepted?
What models are accepted? Every website accepts females, but not always males, couples, etc. So if you aren't just a solo female, make sure you are even allowed to apply for the position before you go through the trouble of submitting all of your paperwork.

4 - How much traffic do they have?
How much traffic do they have? This is really good to know. Generally any large, well known site has millions of visits each month which greatly impacts the money you will be making. Smaller sites, with lower traffic numbers can be a harder place for new webcam models to start.

5 - Can you keep your job private?
Can you keep your job private? Make sure before signing up that the website you choose allows for geographical location restrictions. Basically, make sure that you can block states, countries and areas as you wish. This ensures that you will be completely invisible to places that you don't wish to broadcast to.

6 - Look for specialty features!
Look for specialty features! Does this site allow you to place up wish lists to get goodies? Can you promote your highly important model twitter page? Can you be tipped? Can you do group shows. All of these small, but very important questions, can make or break you in the webcam industry!
