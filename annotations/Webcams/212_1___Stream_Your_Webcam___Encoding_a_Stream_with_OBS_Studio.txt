0 - Encoding a Stream with OBS Studio

1 - Understand what encoding means.
Understand what encoding means. Encoding a stream allows you to send stream content from a third-party application (in this case, OBS Studio) to a streaming service (e.g., YouTube or Twitch). Since many streaming services don't support direct webcam streaming, this is the only way to stream on some platforms.
- Streaming from an encoder often results in much higher-quality live streaming than does using a website's built-in streaming with your webcam.
- When encoding a stream, you'll have to retrieve a key and an address from your selected streaming service and then plug both piece of information into OBS Studio (or any other streaming application).

2 - Install your webcam
Install your webcam if necessary. If your computer doesn't already have a built-in webcam, you'll need to attach and set up an external USB webcam before you'll be able to stream.
- You can buy webcams in virtually any tech store or large online marketplace (e.g., Amazon). They tend to range in price depending on their quality.

3 - Open your service's "Live Stream" section and retrieve your stream key.
