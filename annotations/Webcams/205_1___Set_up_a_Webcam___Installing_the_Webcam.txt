0 - Installing the Webcam

1 - Attach the webcam to your computer.
Attach the webcam to your computer. Plug the webcam's USB cable into one of the rectangular USB ports on the side or back of your computer.
- USB plugs can only be inserted one way. If the plug won't fit into the port, rotate the plug 180 degrees and try again.
- If you're on a Mac, you'll most likely need to buy a USB to USB-C adapter in order to fit a normal webcam.
- Make sure that you plug the webcam directly into your computer, not a USB hub. USB hubs are often too underpowered to operate a webcam.

2 - Insert the webcam's CD.
Insert the webcam's CD. Place the CD that came with the webcam in your computer's CD tray, making sure that the logo is face-up in the process. Since most modern Macs don't come with CD drives, you will have to have a separate CD drive attached via USB cable if you're using a Mac.
- If the webcam didn't come with a CD, skip this step.
- You can usually find a copy of the webcam's software in the "Support" section of the webcam company's website.

3 - Wait for the webcam's setup page to open.
Wait for the webcam's setup page to open. Your webcam's setup page should open automatically. If your webcam didn't include a CD, plugging the webcam into your computer will most likely start the setup process.[1]

4 - Follow any on-screen instructions.
Follow any on-screen instructions. Your webcam's individual instructions will vary, but most setup processes will involve clicking through a series of preference windows before clicking an Install button.
- Pay attention to the windows' information here. You'll most likely need to select certain preferences that will help the webcam work later.

5 - Wait for your webcam to finish installing.
Wait for your webcam to finish installing. Once the webcam has finished installing, its program should open, at which point you can begin setting up the webcam.
