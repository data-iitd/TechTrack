1 - Determine how much you're willing to spend.
Determine how much you're willing to spend. Webcams vary in price, ranging from $25 to $150. Weigh the pros and cons carefully.

2 - Select the brand carefully.
Select the brand carefully. Before buying a webcam, take into consideration the various features.
- Look at the megapixels. The average resolution for standard video should be at least 640 pixels by 480 pixels. For high definition (HD) video, you should buy a webcam with 1,600 pixels by 1,200 pixels. Having more megapixels means that the webcam is more likely to deliver optimal picture quality.
- Consider the frames per second (fps) when buying a webcam. A lower fps rate may create a choppy video and out-of-sync audio. Typically, you want your webcam to perform at 30 or more fps.
- Think about the webcam design when you buy a webcam. If you like to take videos, you'll need pan, tilt and zoom capabilities. If you want to be able to hear audio, make sure your webcam comes with a headset or a built-in microphone.

3 - Evaluate the light sensitivity.
Evaluate the light sensitivity. Some webcams offer exceptional low-light sensitivity, while others do not. Look for a webcam that can handle low light. Consider whether you need software for surveillance, video editing or conferencing, email or stop motion.
- Determine whether you want the warranty. If you're buying a webcam for travel, you may need the warranty to cover damage that occurs during transit. Most new models come with a 1- to 3-year warranty.

4 - Consider your needs.
Consider your needs. You'll need a webcam that supports your computer and lifestyle.
- If you're mobile, you'll need a portable laptop webcam that's compact.
- If you're a Mac user, you'll need a Mac-compatible webcam that supports Mac operating systems and applications.

5 - Evaluate your video viewing needs.
Evaluate your video viewing needs. If you don't have an HD monitor, you will not see the video in HD, even if you buy a webcam with HD features.
- Most webcams on the market are HD capable, but you can adjust the settings to record in a lower resolution or switch from widescreen to standard.
