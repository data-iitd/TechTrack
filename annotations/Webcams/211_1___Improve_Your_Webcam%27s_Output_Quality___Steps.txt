0 - Steps

1 - Have a lamp or some other sight source pointing at you (optimally, your face).
Have a lamp or some other sight source pointing at you (optimally, your face). Do not use your laptop as the primary light source. When the rest of the room is dark and you are sitting in front of your webcam, that is what you are doing.
- Unless you want the particular effect (as in creating a silhouette), don't sit in front of a window. Even if the blinds are closed, your webcam will pick it up.

2 - Diffuse the lamp light that you have directed to your face.
Diffuse the lamp light that you have directed to your face. Typing paper, tissue paper, or something else that will diffuse the light will help soften the light a great deal.

3 - Adjust the brightness and/or contrast on your computer monitor
Adjust the brightness and/or contrast on your computer monitor. You will need to research that for your individual computer monitor because steps would vary depending on your computer. Doing this, as well as having the alternate light source, will get rid of almost all the reflection that is being cast onto you.

4 - Wear a white shirt.
Wear a white shirt. Either that, or wear or have something around you that is white. This makes it easy for your webcam to get the correct white balance without searching for it. It needs to be in the primary focus area of the webcam or it won't work.

5 - Tidy up the background.
Tidy up the background. Make or buy a background. Using a pastel colored sheet will work. You don't have to spend a lot of money. Be sure that what is behind you is at least 5 X 7 feet. Otherwise, the wall or whatever is back there will show.
