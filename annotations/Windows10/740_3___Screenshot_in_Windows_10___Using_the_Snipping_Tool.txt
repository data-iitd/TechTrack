0 - Using the Snipping Tool

1 - Open the Snipping Tool.
Open the Snipping Tool. The Snipping Tool is set to be discontinued in a future version of Windows 10. You can still use the tool as of July 2019, but it's a good idea to switch to the Snip & Sketch tool instead. To open the tool, type Snipping Tool in the Search box and click Snipping Tool.
- See the Using Snip & Sketch method to get started with the new tool.

2 - Click the drop-down arrow next to the "Mode" button.
Click the drop-down arrow next to the "Mode" button. You will see four options to capture the screen:  '"Free-form Snip"', "'Rectangular Snip'", "Window Snip" and "'Full-screen Snip'".

3 - Click the type of screenshot you want to capture.
Click the type of screenshot you want to capture. Here's what each option does:
- 
- Free-form snip: Lets you capture any part of the screen in any shape by tracing freehand.
- Rectangular snip: Lets you capture a section of the screen by drawing a rectangle around it.
- Window snip: Use this tool if you want to capture a single window. After clicking the button, you'll be shown a list of windows you can capture at the bottom of the screen. Click the desired window to take the photo and view the preview.
- Full-screen snip: Captures the entire screen and displays a preview in the tool.

4 - Click the New button.
Click the New button. It's near the top-left corner of the tool. Depending on the mode you selected, you'll experience different results:
- If you chose Free-form or Rectangle, the cursor will turn into a +. Drag the cursor to select the part of the screen you want to capture. When you lift your finger from the mouse, a preview will appear.
- If you choose Full-screen, the whole screen will be captured and a preview will appear.
- If you chose Window, click the window you want to capture to take the photo and view the preview.

5 - Edit the screenshot (optional).
Edit the screenshot (optional). Several editing tools appear at the top of the screen:
