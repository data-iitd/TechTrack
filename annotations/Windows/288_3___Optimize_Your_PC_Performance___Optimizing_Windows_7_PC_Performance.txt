- In the Search box, type Disk Defragmenter.
- Click Disk Defragmenter.
- Under Current status, select the disk you wish to defragment.

- After Windows is done analyzing the disk, it shows you the percentage of fragmentation on the disk. If that number is above 10 percent, you should defragment the disk.
