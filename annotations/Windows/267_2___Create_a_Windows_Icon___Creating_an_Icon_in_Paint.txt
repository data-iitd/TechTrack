1 - Understand the drawbacks of this method.
Understand the drawbacks of this method. While Paint can be used to create a basic icon, its transparency will be affected; this means that some colors won't show up in your icon. For best results, use black and white colors to create your Windows icon in Paint.
- If you want a more complex icon, you can draw the icon in Paint and save it as a JPG file and then use ICO Convert to create an icon.

2 - Open Paint.
Open Paint. Paint is a program included on all Windows computers; you can use Paint to create a simple Windows icon. To open Paint, do the following:
- Open Start 
- Type in paint
- Click Paint at the top of the Start menu.

5 - Zoom in.
Zoom in. Since your canvas is relatively tiny, click the + icon in the bottom-right corner of the window until your canvas is large enough for you to work freely.
