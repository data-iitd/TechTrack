11 - Reboot your computer and reconnect your USB drive.
Reboot your computer and reconnect your USB drive. Now that you're all in the clear, it's a good idea to format the flash drive just in case any issues remain. The remaining steps will walk you through this process.

13 - Copy the recovered files to a safe location on your computer.

- One way to do this is to create a folder on your desktop (right-click the desktop, select New Folder, give it a name, and then press ↵ Enter) and drag the files to it. Don't proceed until these files are moved because you'll be formatting the flash drive.
