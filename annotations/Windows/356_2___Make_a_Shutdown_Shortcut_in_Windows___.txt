1 - Create a new shortcut on your desktop.
Create a new shortcut on your desktop. Right-click on your desktop. Hover the cursor over "New" and click "Shortcut" on the next menu that appears.

2 - Enter the shutdown command.
Enter the shutdown command. Copy and paste the following into the text field:  shutdown.exe -s
- To create a restart shortcut, replace "-s" with "-r" ("shutdown.exe -r").

3 - Adjust the shutdown timer.
Adjust the shutdown timer.  Without changing any settings, the shutdown shortcut will shut down the computer after 30 seconds. To change the timer, add "-t XXX" to the end of the command. XXX represents the number of seconds delay you want prior to shutdown. For example: shutdown.exe -s -t 45 will create a shortcut that shuts down after 45 seconds.
- To add a "goodbye" message, type -c "your message" (including the quotation marks) at the end.

4 - Type a name for the shortcut.
Type a name for the shortcut. Click "Finish" when done.

5 - Change the icon.
Change the icon. If youâ€™d rather have a custom icon instead of the default Program icon that Windows assigns, right-click the shortcut and choose "Properties". In the Shortcut tab, click the Change Icon button. Choose an appropriate icon and then press OK to confirm.

6 - Double-click the shortcut to initiate shutdown.
Double-click the shortcut to initiate shutdown. You'll see a window counting down and your message will be shown. Once the timer runs out, all your programs will start to close and Windows will shut down.
