1 - Check for programs keeping the taskbar open.
Check for programs keeping the taskbar open. If a program is flashing in the taskbar, it won't close. Clicking the flashing program will switch to the program and stop it from trying to notify you.

2 - Check the icons in your system tray.
Check the icons in your system tray. The system tray can be found in the lower-right corner of the screen, next to the clock. Like the programs in your taskbar, icons in your system tray may be keeping the taskbar open when trying to notify you. Click the icon with the notification to see what the program needs.[1]

4 - Try reapplying the settings.
Try reapplying the settings. Sometimes toggling the auto-hide feature off and the on again will fix a taskbar that won't go away. Open the Settings (Windows 10) or Properties window again and turn the auto-hide feature off. Click "Apply" in Windows 8 and earlier versions. Once you've turned it off, toggle it back on again and apply the settings.
