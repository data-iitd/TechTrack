0 - Learning Batch Basics

1 - Open Notepad
Open Notepad. Notepad allows you to create code as a text file and then save it when you're done as a batch file. You can open Notepad by opening Start , typing in Notepad, and clicking the blue Notepad app icon at the top of the menu.
- 		Notepad is commonly used to convert text files into batch files, but you can write your batch file's text virtually anywhere.

2 - Learn some basic batch commands.
Learn some basic batch commands. Batch files run a series of DOS commands, so the commands that you can use are similar to DOS commands. Some of the more important ones include:
- 		
- ECHO - Displays text on the screen
- @ECHO OFF - Hides the text that is normally output
- START - Run a file with its default application
- REM - Inserts a comment line in the program
- MKDIR/RMDIR - Create and remove directories
- DEL - Deletes a file or files
- COPY - Copy a file or files
- XCOPY - Allows you to copy files with extra options
- FOR/IN/DO - This command lets you specify files.
-                         
- TITLE- Edit the title of the window.
- [1]
- X
- Research source

3 - Write a program to create a directory.
Write a program to create a directory. One of the easiest ways to learn how to create batch files is to focus on doing basic tasks first. For example, you can use a batch file to quickly create multiple directories:[2]
- X
- Research source
- 
- 
- MKDIR c:\example1
- MKDIR c:\example2

4 - Write the code to make a basic backup program.
Write the code to make a basic backup program. Batch files are great for running multiple commands, especially if you configure it to be able to run multiple times. With the XCOPY command, you can make a batch file that copies files from select folders to a backup folder, only overwriting files that have been updated since the last copy:
- @ECHO OFF 
- XCOPY c:\original c:\backupfolder /m /e /y
- 
- This copies over files from the folder "original" to the folder "backupfolder". You can replace these with the paths to the folders you want. /m specifies that only updated files will be copied, /e specifies that all subdirectories in the listed directory will be copied, and /y keeps the confirmation message appearing every time a file is overwritten.

5 - Write a more advanced backup program.
Write a more advanced backup program. While simply copying the files from one folder to another is nice, what if you want to do a little sorting at the same time? That's where the FOR/IN/DO command comes in. You can use that command to tell a file where to go depending on the extension:
- @ECHO OFF 
- cd c:\source
- REM This is the location of the files that you want to sort
- FOR %%f IN (*.doc *.txt) DO XCOPY c:\source\"%%f" c:\text /m /y
- REM This moves any files with a .doc or 
- REM .txt extension from c:\source to c:\text
- REM %%f is a variable
- FOR %%f IN (*.jpg *.png *.bmp) DO XCOPY C:\source\"%%f" c:\images /m /y
- REM This moves any files with a .jpg, .png, 
- REM or .bmp extension from c:\source to c:\images

6 - Display some text.
Display some text. If you want to know what is happening in your batch file but don't want to see all the commands, you could program the batch file to print some text that explains what the batch file does. You can print text with ECHO. For example:
- @ECHO OFF
- MKDIR c:\example1
- ECHO Created directory example1
- 
- You can change the color of the output with COLOR bf, where b is the background and f is the foreground color, both a hexadecimal number. Following colors are possible: 
- 
- Number
- Color
- Number
- Color
- 
- 0
- 
-  black  
- 
-   8  
- 
-  dark grey
- 
- 
- 1
- 
-  dark blue  
- 
-  9  
- 
-  blue
- 
- 
- 2
- 
-  dark green  
- 
-  a  
- 
-  green
- 
- 
- 3
- 
-  dark turquoise  
- 
-  b  
- 
-  turquoise
- 
- 
- 4
- 
-  dark red  
- 
-  c  
- 
-  red
- 
- 
- 5
- 
-  dark magenta  
- 
-  d  
- 
-  magenta
- 
- 
- 6
- 
-  dark yellow  
- 
-  e  
- 
-  yellow
- 
- 
- 7
- 
-  light grey  
- 
-  f  
- 
-  white
- 
- 
- For example, red text on a dark green background would be displayed with COLOR 2c
- 
- You need run the batch file from the command line to see the text, because else the window will close too fast to actually read the text you printed.
