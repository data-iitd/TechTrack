0 - Scanning the Image

1 - Place the image for scanning.
Place the image for scanning.  Place documents face down on the printer or scanner surface. Align photo within the arrows or grids on the device. Close the lid if there is one. Press scan on the scanner or use the scanning program on your computer.

2 - Choose your scanning preferences.
Choose your scanning preferences. You'll have the choice of scanning in color, black and white, gray or custom. You can also choose the digital format in which you want to save your picture (jpg, jpeg or tiff).

3 - Choose to preview.
Choose to preview. Clicking preview Â–allows you to review your selection before continuing and make necessary changes to the settings. Use the preview to decide on the type of format, orientation and resolution before continuing. "Orientation" allows the user to select portrait or landscape and "Resolution" determines the sharpness of the image.
- A higher resolution will make the details of the picture more noticeable. To make a sharper image, increase the resolution. Note: This will also increase the size of the image, and dramatically increase the size of the file. You may not be able to send it as an email attachment without making it smaller. Above 300 dpi is unnecessary.

4 - Click "Finish" or "Scan".
Click "Finish" or "Scan". Once you have chose the settings you want in the preview, click finish or scan to continue and complete the process. Which word is used will depend on your program and another one altogether may even be used.

5 - Use the built in program to guide you through the process.
Use the built in program to guide you through the process. Follow the Scan Wizard or other built in program if you still have trouble. The Wizard will show you step-by-step on how to copy pictures from a scanner to the computer or web site.

6 - Save your photos.
Save your photos. Some programs will automatically save your images to a cache within the program itself but for most programs you will need to save the images somewhere on your computer or upload them directly to the internet. Look for the save button or use the save prompt when it comes up. Save the pictures somewhere where you won't lose them.
- You don't have have to worry about renaming every photo. If you have a large number of photos that can take a long time!
