13 - Save your session (Frugal installs only).
Save your session (Frugal installs only). If you did a Full install, any changes you make to the system will save automatically. Frugal installs, whether on a USB or internal drive, require you to save your session when exiting. Here's how to do it:
- Go to Menu > Shut Down > Reboot Computer.
- Click SAVE on the pop-up window.
- Select a file system and click OK.
- Type a name for the saved session and click OK.
- Select Normal if you don't need to encrypt the file (common), or select an encryption method and then follow the on-screen instructions.
- Select a save file size and click OK. 512MB usually works just fine.
- If the current save location works for you, click YES, SAVE. If not, click CHANGE FOLDER and select a different location. It's fine to save to your bootable installation media (even the CD/DVD, if it's re-writable). Once the file is saved, the computer will reboot.
