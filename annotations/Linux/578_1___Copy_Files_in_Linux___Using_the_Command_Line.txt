- Make sure you capitalize the folder's name if necessary.

Type in the "copy" tag. This tag is cp with a space after it.

Enter a file's name. Type in the name and extension of the file you want to copy after cp and the space, then add a space.
- For example, if you want to copy a file named "hello", you would type cp hello into Terminal.
- If the file name has an extension on the end of it (e.g., ".desktop"), make sure you include the extension in the file's name when typing it into Terminal.

5 - Enter the destination folder.
Enter the destination folder. Type in the path for the folder into which you want to copy the file.
