0 - Creating Partitions

1 - Check your existing drives.
Check your existing drives. You'll have at least two drives available: your computer's hard drive, and the Arch Linux installation media. To check your current drives:
- Type in fdisk -l and press ↵ Enter.
- Find the name of the largest hard drive on the results screen. The name will be something like "/dev/sda" and can be found to the right of the "Disk" heading.

2 - Bring up the partition page.
Bring up the partition page. Type in cfdisk [drive name], making sure to replace [drive name] with your hard drive's name, and press ↵ Enter, then select DOS and press ↵ Enter again.
- For example: if the drive is named "/dev/sda", you would type cfdisk /dev/sda into the terminal.

3 - Delete the hard drive's contents.
Delete the hard drive's contents. Select a partition in the middle of the screen, select Delete at the bottom of the screen, press ↵ Enter, and repeat for any other partitions in the middle of the screen. You should ultimately be left with a line entitled Pri/Log    Free Space.

4 - Create a "swap" partition.
Create a "swap" partition. This partition will function as your system's backup memory if and when you are consuming all of your RAM.   To do so:
- Select New and press ↵ Enter.
- Select Primary and press ↵ Enter.
- Type in a number of megabytes (e.g., 1024 for one gigabyte) and press ↵ Enter. As a rule of thumb, you should make the swap partition 2 or 3 times your RAM (e.g., if you have 4 gigabytes of RAM, you should make the swap partition 8192 or 12288 megabytes).
- Select End and press ↵ Enter.

5 - Create your main hard drive partition.
Create your main hard drive partition. This is the partition on which your Arch Linux operating system, files, and other information will be stored. To do this:
- Make sure that the Pri/Log    Free Space partition is selected.
- Select New and press ↵ Enter.
- Select Primary and press ↵ Enter.
- Make sure that the number next to the "Size (in MB)" heading is correct.
- Press ↵ Enter.
- Select the primary partition again.
- Select Bootable and press ↵ Enter.

6 - Label the "swap" partition.
Label the "swap" partition. This will set it as your system's RAM:
- Select the "swap" partition.
- Select Type and press ↵ Enter.
- Type in 82 and press ↵ Enter.
- With the "swap" partition still selected, select Write and press ↵ Enter.
- Type in yes and press ↵ Enter.

7 - Note the names of your partitions.
Note the names of your partitions. In the "Name" column on the far-left side of the screen, you should see a name (e.g., "sda1") next to your "swap" partition, and a similar name (e.g., "sda2") next to the primary partition. You'll need both of these names in order to format your partitions.

8 - Exit the "cfdisk" utility.
Exit the "cfdisk" utility. Select Quit and press ↵ Enter to do so.

9 - Format your primary partition.
Format your primary partition. This will make it usable with your operating system. To do this, type in mkfs.ext4 /dev/[primary partition name] and press ↵ Enter.
- For a partition named "sda2", you'd enter mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2 here.

10 - Mount the formatted partition.
Mount the formatted partition. Type in mount /dev/[partition name] /mnt and press ↵ Enter. This will make the partition into a usable drive.

11 - Add a swap file to the "swap" partition.
Add a swap file to the "swap" partition. Type in mkswap /dev/[partition name] and press ↵ Enter, then type in swapon /dev/sda1 and press ↵ Enter again. After completing this step, you can proceed with installing Arch Linux.
- For a "swap" partition named "sda1", for example, you'd enter mkswap /dev/sda1 and then swapon /dev/sda1 here.
