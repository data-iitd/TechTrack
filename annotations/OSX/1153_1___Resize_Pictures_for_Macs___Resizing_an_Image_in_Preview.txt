5 - Change the resolution.
Change the resolution. Resolution is measured in pixels per inch (also called “dots per inch” or “dpi”). If you plan to print your image or simply want it to retain as much of its quality as possible, consider raising the resolution.
- If your image is for the web or for use in an app like Facebook, the default (72) is fine. If you start with a higher resolution, reducing it will give you a smaller file size.
- If you plan to print your image in a high-quality format, such as for advertisements or other forms of business communications, set it to at least 600. Note: this will raise the size of the file significantly.
- To print glossy photos, 300 will suffice. The file size will be much larger than that of a default 72 dpi image, but the final quality will be worth it.

6 - Type your desired width and height in the designated boxes.
Type your desired width and height in the designated boxes. The larger the width and height, the larger the file size.
- It may be helpful to change the unit of measurement to best visualize your image. For example, you can change it to “cm” if you want to specify the width in centimeters. Click the drop-down right next to both Width and Height to make your selection.
- If you would prefer, you can choose the size by selecting a percentage of the current size. Select “Scale,” then choose a percentage from the drop-down.
