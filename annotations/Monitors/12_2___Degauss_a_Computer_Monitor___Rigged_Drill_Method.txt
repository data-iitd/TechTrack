0 - Rigged Drill Method

1 - Get a magnet and tape it to the end of a high RPM drill and make sure it is held in place very tightly, use Duct or packing tape.
Get a magnet and tape it to the end of a high RPM drill and make sure it is held in place very tightly, use Duct or packing tape.
- You could also use a small electric fan. The motor creates the same magnetic field as the drill. When you turn on the fan hold the back of it onto the screen. From then you can go on from step 4.

2 - Hold the rigged drill next to the spot to be fixed, make sure it is about 2–3 centimeter (0.8–1.2 in) away from the screen.

3 - Now pull the trigger an you'll see the screen blur rapidly, this is normal so do not worry.

4 - While the drill is running, slowly pull away from the screen and you may see it is fixed.

5 - This process may need to be repeated due to magnet strength and drill speed but it will work.

6 - Due to physics the fast, random turning of the magnet/s will fix the screen's colors.
