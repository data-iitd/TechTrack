0 - Preparing to Calibrate

1 - Understand when your monitor needs calibration.
Understand when your monitor needs calibration. Typically speaking, high-resolution monitors that you connect to a desktop unit (e.g., a 4K display) require some calibration before they'll display correctly the colors and items on your screen. Failing to calibrate such monitors can result in washed-out or blurry textures.
- Lower-quality monitors (e.g., 720p ones)—especially ones used for gaming or other casual activities—don't need to be calibrated, though calibration won't hurt them.
- Built-in monitors such as the ones included in laptops rarely need calibration, though you're more than welcome to calibrate built-in monitors using the same process you'd follow for a separate one.

2 - Clean your monitor if necessary.
Clean your monitor if necessary. If your monitor is dirty or smudged, take a moment to wipe it down before attempting to calibrate it.

3 - Place your monitor in a neutral lighting environment.
Place your monitor in a neutral lighting environment. Your monitor shouldn't have any glare or direct light shining on it; for best results, make sure your monitor is in a room where it can remain unimpacted by direct natural and artificial light.

4 - Connect your monitor using a high-quality cable.
Connect your monitor using a high-quality cable. If possible, make sure your monitor is connected to your computer using a DisplayPort cable.
- You can use an HDMI cable instead if you don't have access to a DisplayPort option, but refrain from using a DVI, VGA, or lower connector.

5 - Turn on your monitor for at least 30 minutes before continuing.
Turn on your monitor for at least 30 minutes before continuing. This will give your monitor plenty of time to warm up.[1]

- If your computer is set to hibernate or use a screensaver, move the mouse every few minutes to keep your screen from turning off.

6 - Change your monitor's resolution back to default if necessary.
Change your monitor's resolution back to default if necessary. By default, your monitor should display in the highest possible resolution, which is necessary for calibration:
- 
- Windows — Open Start , click Settings , click System, click Display, click the "Resolution" drop-down box, and click the "Recommended" resolution. Click Keep changes when prompted.
- Mac — Open the Apple menu , click System Preferences..., click Displays, click the Display tab, hold down ⌥ Option while clicking Scaled, select your connected display, and check the "Default for display" box.
