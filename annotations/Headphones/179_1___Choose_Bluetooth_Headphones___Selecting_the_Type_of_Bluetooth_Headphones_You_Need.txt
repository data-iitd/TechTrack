1 - Choose Bluetooth headphones for wireless connectivity.
Choose Bluetooth headphones for wireless connectivity. Bluetooth headphones have the advantage of being wireless which can make carrying them that much easier. While the benefit of going wireless means less fumbling with cables and cords, Bluetooth headphones need to be charged on a regular basis. Furthermore, if you forget to pay attention to the battery life, it can run out during mid-use which can be frustrating so think about where and when you’ll be using them to inform your decision.[1]

3 - Pick the lighter earbud variety for quick and easy use.
Pick the lighter earbud variety for quick and easy use. There’s a slight difference between Bluetooth earbuds and Bluetooth headphones. Earbuds fit directly into your ear and weigh close to nothing. These are great if you simply want to get up and go out as they’re very easy travel with. However they generally have lower quality sound compared to over-the-ear headphones due to not being able to drown out as much outside noise.[4]

4 - Get over-the-ear headphones for the highest quality sound.
Get over-the-ear headphones for the highest quality sound. Over-the-ear headphones have superior sound to earbuds due to having larger and better technology. They also have huge noise reduction that blocks out surrounding sound from the outside, thereby isolating your music.[5]
