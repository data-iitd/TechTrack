0 - Wrapping the Cord Properly

1 - Hold the cord between your thumb and forefinger so the plug faces your body.
Hold the cord between your thumb and forefinger so the plug faces your body. Start by holding the cord with your non-dominant so your palm faces up. Pinch the thick plastic around the auxiliary jack so the metal end points towards your body. Run the cord behind your hand so it hangs down.[1]

- If you have over-ear headphones, check if you can unplug the cord from the earpieces. This will make it easier to wrap.[2]

2 - Loop a length of the cord around your fingers.
Loop a length of the cord around your fingers. Grab a part of the cord hanging down with your dominant hand and wrap it around your non-dominant hand. Don’t wrap the cord tightly or you else you could strain the wires inside the cord. Hold the top of the loop with your forefinger and thumb next to the jack.[3]

3 - Grab a length cord with your palm facing away from your body.
Grab a length cord with your palm facing away from your body. Twist your dominant hand as if you were giving an upside-down handshake and grab the cord. Use the same amount of cord as you used with your first loop.[4]

4 - Pull the cord up to the top of the loop.
Pull the cord up to the top of the loop. As you lift the cord, twist your wrist back towards your body so the cord forms a loop. Tightly pinch the top of the loop next to the other loop wrapped around your non-dominant hand.[5]

- This known as the over-under wrapping method and is used to prevent cords and cables from twisting.

5 - Repeat the over-under technique until the cord is wrapped.
Repeat the over-under technique until the cord is wrapped. Alternate between regular loops and the upside-down loop for the entire length of the cord. The cord won’t bunch up or twist, allowing it to easily unfurl when you’re ready to use them again.[6]

- If you wrap your headphones without using the over-under technique, the wires inside will twist and kink. This could damage your headphones after you repeatedly wrap them.

6 - Hold the cord together with a twist tie.
Hold the cord together with a twist tie. Wrap a twist tie around the loose ends of the cord to secure them to the rest of the loops. Spin the ends of the twist tie to hold it in place.[7]
