0 - Purchasing Well-Fitting Earbuds

1 - Choose sport earbuds with ear hooks for working out.
Choose sport earbuds with ear hooks for working out. If you plan on using earbuds while exercising, basic circular earbuds might not cut it, no matter how well they fit. Invest in specialized sport headphones with features like ear hooks and bands that wrap around the head to ensure a safe and slip-free listening experience during your workout.
- Although earbuds with a hook that wrap around the back of the ear are a popular choice for athletes, some of these may cause skin chafing when worn for long periods of time. Consider well-fitting earbuds with smaller "ear fins" or wireless earbuds as an alternative if you have this problem.[6]

2 - Buy sweat-proof earbuds for exercise.
Buy sweat-proof earbuds for exercise. If you wear earbuds during vigorous exercise or in hot weather, sweat may cause your earbuds to slip out. Look for earbuds labeled as "sweat-proof" if you expect to sweat while wearing them.

3 - Purchase waterproof earbuds for use in all weather.
Purchase waterproof earbuds for use in all weather. If your earbuds may be exposed to water, such as during long distance running or winter sports, choose waterproof earbuds to make sure that excess moisture doesn't cause your earbuds to fall out.
- Check for an IP (International Protection) rating on the package to ensure your earbuds are certified as sweat-proof or waterproof. Some brands may falsely advertise as such. For example, a rating of IPX4 is the standard for sweat-proof (but not waterproof) workout headphones.
- You can even purchase earbuds that are safe to use while swimming! These will have a rating of IPX8.

4 - Buy wireless earbuds if cord tugging is an issue.
Buy wireless earbuds if cord tugging is an issue. If your earbud slippage is caused by the cord being pulled or caught on clothing or other objects, try wireless earbuds. These are on the more expensive side, but if you use earbuds frequently they are a worthwhile investment. These days, a wide range of wireless bluetooth earbuds are available.[7]

5 - Purchase earbuds designed for smaller ears if necessary.
Purchase earbuds designed for smaller ears if necessary. If you've tried everything and still can't keep your earbuds from falling out, you may simply have a particularly small ear canal. In this case, you may want to purchase earbuds designed for smaller ears.
- Women are more likely to have smaller than average ears, which can prevent earbuds from fully entering the ear canal. There are plenty of earbuds for sale that come with extra small attachments, and even many that are marked as being for women. [8]

- Certain people lack cartilage on the part of the ear that normally surrounds an earbud. This is sometimes called Ear Cartilage Deficiency Syndrome. If you have always found it very difficult to wear earbuds, you may want to examine your ears for this feature and purchase earbuds with extra support, such as those with ear hooks.[9]
