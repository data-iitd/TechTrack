0 - Cleaning with Cotton Swabs

1 - Purchase cotton swabs.
Purchase cotton swabs. Cotton swabs, also known as Q-tips, can be found at general stores and other locations where health and beauty products are sold. Try to get ones that don't look very fluffy so that pieces don't get left behind in the jack. Swabs with thinner tips work better, because they are easier to fit inside the jack.

2 - Remove cotton from the swab's tip.
Remove cotton from the swab's tip. On one end of the swab, begin tearing or cutting off cotton. Make the tip as close to the width of the swab's middle portion as possible. Once the swab tip is this size, it should fit comfortably inside the jack.[3]

3 - Gently brush the jack.
Gently brush the jack. Don't jam the swab into the jack. Slowly push it in until it rests inside the hole. Spin the swab to brush off all sides of the jack. Remove the swab and most debris will fall out.[4]

4 - Swab with rubbing alcohol.
Swab with rubbing alcohol. For difficult debris, you can dip the swab in some rubbing alcohol. Make sure the swab is lightly coated, not soaked or dripping. Squeeze out excess moisture first. Put the swab back inside the jack and spin it again.[5]

- Rubbing alcohol can corrode the metal, so use it sparingly.

5 - Dry out the jack with a clean swab.
Dry out the jack with a clean swab. The rubbing alcohol should dry quickly on its own. However, you can remove excess moisture to minimize the jack's exposure. Stick a clean swab into the jack. Leave it in there for a moment and spin it around to collect the alcohol.
