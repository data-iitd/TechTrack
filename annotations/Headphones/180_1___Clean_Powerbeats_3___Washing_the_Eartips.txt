- Don’t use any harsh cleaning chemicals since it could weaken the plastic and ruin the eartips.

3 - Wipe the eartips with the damp cloth to remove wax.
Wipe the eartips with the damp cloth to remove wax. Wrap your cloth around the eartips and rub them back and forth. Squeeze the eartips inside of the cloth to get rid of any wax that built up inside. Take the eartips out of the cloth every few seconds to see if they’re still dirty, and keep wiping them until they look clean.[6]

4 - Rinse the eartips under clean warm water.
Rinse the eartips under clean warm water. You can either run the eartips directly under your faucet or use a new cloth to wipe them. Clean off any residual soap that’s still on the eartips since it could irritate your skin later on. Shake off any excess water after you rinse the tips so they aren’t soaking wet.[7]

5 - Dry the eartips completely with a paper towel.
Dry the eartips completely with a paper towel. Wrap the eartips in a clean piece of paper towel and squeeze tightly to dry them. If the paper towel gets too wet, get another dry piece and continue patting them dry. If the ear tips still feel wet, leave them on the paper towel until they dry off entirely.[8]

6 - Push the eartips back onto your Powerbeats.
Push the eartips back onto your Powerbeats. Look for the opening on the back of the eartip and align it with the plastic speaker tube on your earphone.
