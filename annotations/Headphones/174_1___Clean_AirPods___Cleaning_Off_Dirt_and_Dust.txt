4 - Brush the speaker grills with an anti-static brush.
Brush the speaker grills with an anti-static brush. If you don’t have an anti-static brush, you can use the bristles on a clean, dry toothbrush instead. Use the bristles on the anti-static brush to brush away dust, dirt, or wax that’s stuck in the speaker grills. Use a gentle brushing motion so you don’t damage the grills.[5]

5 - Use a damp microfiber cloth as a last resort.
Use a damp microfiber cloth as a last resort. If your AirPods haven’t been cleaned in a while, you may need to use a little bit of water to remove tough dirt and grime spots. Add a drop or two of distilled water onto a microfiber cloth so that it’s barely wet. Then, rub the damp part of the cloth over the surface of your AirPods. Don’t let the wet part of the cloth make contact with the speaker grills or moisture could get inside of them.[6]
