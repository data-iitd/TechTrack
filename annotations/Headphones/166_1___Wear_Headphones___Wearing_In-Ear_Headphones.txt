1 - Place the squishy tip just inside your left ear hole.
Place the squishy tip just inside your left ear hole. In-ear headphones look a lot like ear buds, but they aren’t worn in exactly the same way. Ear buds hang from the crevices of your ear-folds, whereas in-ear headphones are inserted directly into the ear canals. Start by situating the squishy tip gently in your ear hole, over the canal. Don’t push it in, just get it in place.[4]

2 - Pull the left earlobe down and push the tip into your ear canal.
Pull the left earlobe down and push the tip into your ear canal. Tug your left earlobe down gently with your right hand, which will widen your ear canal. Use your left index finger to carefully push the squishy tip of the left ear speaker into your left ear canal.[5]

- You do not need to push far. The tip fits just inside the canal.

3 - Release the left earlobe to create a seal.
Release the left earlobe to create a seal. Once you’ve inserted the speaker gently into the ear canal, let go of your earlobe. Your ear canal will return to its normal size, causing the walls of your ear canal to hug the speaker. This creates a seal, which ensures good audio. Without getting that proper seal, the audio quality might suffer.[6]

- You've achieved the proper seal when the sound around you is almost impossible to pick up. You will feel enclosed, in a way, because all sound is isolated in your canal.

4 - Do the same thing with the right ear.
Do the same thing with the right ear. Gently pull down the lobe and insert the speaker. Release the earlobe to create the seal, which cancels out background noise and provides quality audio. You may need to repeat this a few times until you get a feel for how your headphones fit. Always be gentle and never shove the speakers into your ear canals.[7]

5 - Experiment with tip sizes.
Experiment with tip sizes. In-ear headphones aren’t one size fits all, and there should be a range of squishy rubber tips that came with your earphones. These different sizes fit different-sized ear canals. Start with the smallest tips first and, if those doesn’t fit comfortably, go up a size. Keep trying until you find the size that creates that perfect seal.[8]

- If rubber tips aren’t working for you, go online to purchase foam tips. These tend to work well for most hard-to-fit people.
