0 - Preparing a Burn-in Playlist

1 - Select music with a wide range of frequencies.
Select music with a wide range of frequencies. You will need at least 40 hours of music or sound. The more hours you can get without having to loop the playlist, the better. You want lots of different music so it loosens the drivers in your headphones and they become accustomed to producing various sounds at an optimal level.[1]

- Even if you don’t like a particular genre of music, you should include it in your playlist to give your headphones the best workout.
- Add a mixture of pop, rock, heavy metal, rap, hip-hop and R&B, country, and classical music to ensure a wide range.

2 - Incorporate periods of white noise and pink noise on your playlist.
Incorporate periods of white noise and pink noise on your playlist. You can use your audio software to loop pink and/or white noise so that it plays for an extended period of time. An easier method would be to find a video that plays pink or white noise on YouTube and play it through your headphones.[2]

- For good measure, search “frequency sweeps” on YouTube to include 20-20000 Hz, 10-30000 Hz, and 20-200 Hz frequency sweeps on your playlist.

3 - Use a program on your computer to make a playlist of the burn-in tracks.
Use a program on your computer to make a playlist of the burn-in tracks. Alternate the music genres to encourage your headphones to adjust to the various changes in bass, treble, and frequency. Programs like Windows Media Player, iTunes, and Winamp are easy to use for making custom playlists.
- Add the songs you want, then organize the files by alternating the genres. For instance, play a country song followed by a heavy metal track.[3]

4 - Get a pre-recorded audio file if you don’t have time to make a playlist.
Get a pre-recorded audio file if you don’t have time to make a playlist. Search online for “audio burn-in file.” You will find free options to use online players featuring a pre-recorded audio file, as well as options to download the file to play without using an internet connection.[4]

- If you go this route, simply follow the instructions provided with the program.

5 - Download a burn-in app if you want to use your phone.
Download a burn-in app if you want to use your phone. Both iTunes and Google Play offer apps specifically designed for burning-in your headphones. The apps are essentially the same as an audio file—with pre-built playlists that alternate music, noise, and rest periods—just made for your phone.
- Many of these apps are free, but some cost up to $2.99. Read the product descriptions and reviews to find which app might work the best for you.
