1 - Take the plastic eartips off from the Powerbeats.
Take the plastic eartips off from the Powerbeats. Grip the soft plastic tip and twist it in either direction to loosen it. Gently pull the tip off of the earphone and set it aside in a place where you won’t lose it. Then remove the second tip from your other earphone.[10]

2 - Scrape around the speaker’s edges with a toothpick or cleaning tool.
Scrape around the speaker’s edges with a toothpick or cleaning tool. Place the point of your toothpick or cleaning tool along the circular edge by the Powerbeats’ speaker. Lightly scrape around the plastic to remove the wax built up on the surface. Wipe the wax off of the toothpick or tool with a paper towel so you don’t wipe it back onto the speaker.[11]

- Earphone cleaning tools usually have a pointed or looped end as well as a small bristle brush on the other. You can buy them from your local electronics store.

3 - Use a toothbrush on the mesh to remove stuck-on wax.
Use a toothbrush on the mesh to remove stuck-on wax. Hold your Powerbeats so the speaker mesh points down. Lightly rub the mesh in circular motions with a soft-bristle toothbrush to break apart the dried wax. Avoid pressing too hard with your brush since you could damage the speaker or push the wax deeper into the mesh.[12]

- You can also use the brush on an earphone cleaning tool if you have one.
- Try tapping the top of your Powerbeats with the back of the toothbrush to force small, dried pieces of wax to fall out.

4 - Push a cleaning putty into the mesh to pull out residual wax pieces.
Push a cleaning putty into the mesh to pull out residual wax pieces. Knead the cleaning putty in your hands to soften it and make it easier to work with. Press and shape the putty lightly against the mesh until it’s completely covered. Pull the putty straight out from the mesh to remove any small leftover bits of wax. Wipe the putty with a lint-free rag to help it stay clean so you’re able to use it again.[13]

5 - Put the eartips back onto your earphones.
Put the eartips back onto your earphones. Line up the hole on the bottom of the ear tip with the top of the speaker tube. Lightly press down on the eartip until it snaps against the earphone. Make sure the eartip doesn’t sit crooked since it could fall out. Then put the second eartip back in your other earphone.[14]
