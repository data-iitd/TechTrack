4 - Spray compressed air into the keyboard of a MacBook (early 2015 or later).
Spray compressed air into the keyboard of a MacBook (early 2015 or later). First, turn the keyboard at a 75 degree angle, so it is not quite vertical. Then, spray some compressed air left to right across the surface of the keyboard. Keep the straw of the air compression can about Â½ inch away from the keys. After spraying the whole keyboard, rotate it 90 degrees to one side, and spray all keys again from left to right. Repeat this until you have sprayed the keyboard at all angles.[3]
