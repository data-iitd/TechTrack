0 - Reinstalling the Retaining Clip

1 - Examine the pieces for breaks.
Examine the pieces for breaks. The retaining clip is made out of two pieces. The larger square or U shape fits onto the keyboard base and the key cap. The smaller piece, with a circular hole in the center, fits onto a small tab on the keyboard base. The two pieces fit together with two small tabs, one on either side of the smaller piece. If one of these pieces is missing or broken, order a replacement key or retaining clip for your exact keyboard model. If both pieces seem intact, continue to the next step.
- Before ordering a replacement key, make sure it includes a retaining clip. These are also sold as "hinges."
- Alternatively, carefully detach a clip from a key you don't use as often, and reattach it to the broken key.
- On some models, the tabs are separate pieces. If they fall out, you can slot them back in with a pair of tweezers.

2 - Examine a nearby key.
Examine a nearby key. Even on the same keyboard, different retaining clips may be arranged in different way. Lift an adjacent key cap the same size as the key you're replacing, by levering up the corners. Examine the exposed retaining clip as you repair the key. This will make it much easier to figure out how each piece slots in.

3 - Fit the larger piece onto the keyboard.
Fit the larger piece onto the keyboard. On some models, you'll need to squeeze the larger piece's sides in order to fit it into the slots on the keyboard base.[4]

-  Do this before attaching the two pieces together. Once attached to the keyboard base, you should be able to lift the piece a short distance.
- Only one side of this piece attaches to the keyboard.

4 - Slot the smaller piece into the keyboard.
Slot the smaller piece into the keyboard. Hold the smaller piece with the concave side facing down â€” or feel the piece until you find a groove, and keep that side face-down.[5]

-  Lower it onto the tabs on the keyboard base until they hook onto the retention clip's groove.

5 - Fit the two pieces together.
Fit the two pieces together. Look for the two pins on the side of the smaller clip. Gently press these into the sides of the larger clip, until the two pieces are attached.
- Using too much force here will break your retaining clip.

6 - Fit the cap back on.
Fit the cap back on. Hook the key cap back over the retaining clip. Press down until you hear two snaps and the key remains firmly attached.
