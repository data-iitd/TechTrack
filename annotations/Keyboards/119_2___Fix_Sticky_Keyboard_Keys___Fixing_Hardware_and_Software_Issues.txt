2 - Update your keyboard's drivers
Update your keyboard's drivers. Most of the time, keyboard issues can be tied to out-of-date drivers or software. You can fix the keyboard by updating the driver or software. The easiest way to ensure your drivers are up to date is by using your computer's update utility:
- 
- Windows — Open Start, click the Settings gear, click Update & Security, click Windows Update, click Check for updates, and install any available updates.
- Mac — Open the Apple menu, click App Store..., click the Updates tab, and click UPDATE ALL if it's available.
- If you have a mechanical keyboard, another way you can update your keyboard's drivers is by going to the keyboard manufacturer's website, finding your model of keyboard, and looking for a driver download. You can then download the keyboard's driver file and double-click it to run it.

3 - Reinstall the keyboard.
