0 - Sitting at the Keyboard

1 - Sit with good posture.
Sit with good posture. In order to prevent strain on your hands, back, neck, and other joints, you'll want to sit at the keyboard with good posture. Sit slightly reclined in your seat, allowing the chair to support your lower back. Ideally, your elbows should be angled down slightly to promote circulation. Your feet should be planted firmly on the floor.[1]

- Standing desks are growing increasingly popular, but an improper desk can promote bad posture. Your standing desk should be elbow-level or just slightly lower. Your monitor should be eye-level to keep you from hunching over, and should be around two feet from your eyes.[2]

2 - Center the keyboard.
Center the keyboard. When typing, your keyboard's spacebar should be centered to your body. This will help keep you from having to rotate to reach the keys.

3 - Avoid resting your palms or wrist.
Avoid resting your palms or wrist. Your hands should float above the keys while you type. This will help you reach keys by moving your hands instead of stretching your fingers. Resting your palms or your wrist on the front of the keyboard and stretching your fingers promotes carpal tunnel syndrome

4 - Use a soft touch.
Use a soft touch. Most keyboards are fairly sensitive and don't need much pressure for the key to register. Lightly tapping keys will help keep your fingers active and will improve your speed.
- Keep your wrists straight as you type. Twisting your wrists can cause discomfort and unnecessary stress.

5 - Relax your hands when you’re not typing.
Relax your hands when you’re not typing. When you're not actively typing, rest your hands. Keeping your hands tense when not typing can increase stiffness and soreness later.
