0 - Installing a Wall-Mounted Keyboard Tray

1 - Choose an adjustable tray so you can change the height and angle.
Choose an adjustable tray so you can change the height and angle. Rather than buying a stationary tray or shelf, look for something that you can raise, lower, and tilt so you can adjust it to your liking. Make sure the tray is large enough to hold your keyboard and has room on the side for you to move your mouse around. Check your local office supply store or search online for your tray.[8]

- Wall-mounted keyboard trays can cost as low as $30 USD, but more expensive and versatile models may be more than $200 USD.

2 - Find a stud in your wall near to mount the tray arm.
Find a stud in your wall near to mount the tray arm. Run a stud finder flat against the wall near your workstation and turn it on. Slowly move the stud finder side to side along the wall until you see it light up or hear it beep. Make a dot on the location at the top of the stud finder to mark the edge of the stud. Keep moving the finder over in the same direction until the light turns off to find the other edge of the stud.[9]

- If you don’t have a stud finder, tap on the wall with your fist. If you hear a solid thunk, there’s usually a stud behind the wall. If you hear a hollow echo, then there isn’t a stud there.

3 - Mark the mount’s holes on your wall about 36 in (91 cm) from the floor.
Mark the mount’s holes on your wall about 36 in (91 cm) from the floor. Take the tray mount out, which tends to look like a long flat piece with grooves on the side. Measure up 36 inches (91 cm) from the floor and place the center of the mount there so it’s against the stud. Keep the mount vertical and use a pencil to mark the screw holes along the edges.[10]

- Typically, you’ll need your keyboard around 22–30 inches (56–76 cm) off the floor while you’re sitting and 36–46 inches (91–117 cm) if you’re standing. Even though the mount may be too high, you’ll be able to adjust the mount’s arm to raise and lower it to the proper height.
- Every wall mount is different, so follow the instructions that came with your keyboard tray.

4 - Drill pilot holes into your wall on the locations you marked.
Drill pilot holes into your wall on the locations you marked. Secure a 1⁄8 in (0.32 cm) bit in the end of your drill. Place the end of the bit against one of the marks you made so it’s perpendicular to the wall. Pull the trigger on the drill to bore holes into the wall about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep. Continue drilling the rest of the holes for the mount.[11]

- If you have metal studs or concrete walls, use a drill bit meant for cutting through the material. Otherwise, it may break and you could injure yourself.

5 - Screw the mount onto your wall with a screwdriver.
Screw the mount onto your wall with a screwdriver. Hold the mount against your wall so the holes on it line up with the ones you just drilled. Feed screws through the mount and into the holes. Tighten the screws with a screwdriver until the back of the mount sits flush against the wall. Make sure the mount doesn’t wobble or creak.[12]

- Stop tightening your screws as soon as you feel resistance so you don’t damage your walls.

6 - Attach the arm with the keyboard tray to the mount using the provided screws.
Attach the arm with the keyboard tray to the mount using the provided screws. Find the adjustable arm that has the large tray attached to it and locate the backplate, which will look flat and have multiple holes drilled through it. Hold the backplate against the mount on your wall so there are holes that line up with one another. Feed screws through the backplate and mount and tighten them completely to secure the arm to the wall.[13]
