0 - Repairing a Loose Key

1 - Turn off your computer.
Turn off your computer. Unplug it as well. Repairing a keyboard is not dangerous, but it's always a good idea to take these precautions before you repair a computer.

2 - Remove the key cap.
Remove the key cap. Most loose keys should come away easily, with some gentle wiggling to unhook them from the retaining clip. If necessary, lever out the key cap from the corners with a flat head screwdriver.

3 - Check the attachment points on the key.
Check the attachment points on the key. The base of the key cap should have up to four attachment points, where the key clips onto the keyboard below. Look closely for signs of a broken attachment. Continue on to one of the steps below depending on what you see.
- If you're not sure, remove a functional key of the same size by gently levering out each corner with a screwdriver. Compare the attachment points on the two keys.

4 - Replace a broken key cap.
Replace a broken key cap. If the attachment points are broken, you will need a new key. Purchase one online, making sure it matches your laptop model and the location of the attachment points. To put in the new key, hook one attachment point onto the keyboard, then rub your finger over the key until you hear two loud snaps, one at each end of the key.
- Alternatively, remove a key of the same size that you rarely use. Place it in the former key's position.

5 - Fix the metal bar on large keys.
Fix the metal bar on large keys. The space bar and â‡§ Shift keys are held flat by a metal bar. If this bar is not flat, you may need to re-attach it to the small plastic hooks on the keyboard. The bar should run along the lower end of the key, with the short arms of the bar running up the left and right sides and onto the hooks. Once the bar is reattached, press the key cap over it and test it.
- Once the bar is out of place, it often continues to have minor problems or gets a tendency to slip out of place again. Consider buying a replacement keyboard for your laptop, or having it repaired at a computer repair store.
- If you are installing a replacement for one of these keys, the replacement will come with its own bar. Remove the old bar first by gently levering it upward with a flat screwdriver.[1]

6 - Check for other problems.
Check for other problems. Loose keys are almost always caused by damage to the key cap itself, or the metal bar of large keys. If you're certain the key cap is in good condition, read the section on stuck keys below. This covers damage due to spills, broken retaining clips, or a damaged membrane.
