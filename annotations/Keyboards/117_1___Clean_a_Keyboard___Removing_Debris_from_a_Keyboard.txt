0 - Removing Debris from a Keyboard

1 - Shut down the computer and detach all connecting cables.
Shut down the computer and detach all connecting cables. To protect your hardware from damage, shut off your computer first before attempting to clean the keyboard. If your keyboard is wired, pull out the plug connecting it to the computer. If you can't remove the keyboard, such as when cleaning a laptop, disconnect your computer's power cable to eliminate the risk of electrical shock.[1]

- USB keyboards can be unplugged before you shut down the computer. Doing this with a non-USB keyboard may damage your computer, so if you're unsure, always shut down the computer first.
- Take the batteries out of wireless keyboards, especially if you plan on deep cleaning the keys.

2 - Turn the keyboard upside down to shake out loose debris.
Turn the keyboard upside down to shake out loose debris. Flip your keyboard and knock off as much loose debris as possible. Be gentle when shaking the keyboard. Most food crumbs, dirt, pet hair, and other debris will fall out right away. Tilt the keyboard in different directions and tap it a little harder to force out any leftover debris you notice.[2]

- Listen for the sound of debris rattling around inside the keyboard. This happens sometimes with mechanical keyboards and other devices with raised keys. Consider taking the keyboard apart to give it a deep cleaning.
- If you're cleaning a laptop, hold the screen open while supporting the computer's base with your other hand.

3 - Use compressed air to blow dust and debris out from the keys.
Use compressed air to blow dust and debris out from the keys. Compressed air is your most reliable tool for general cleaning. Hold the canister at a 45-degree angle while pointing it at the keys. Sweep the nozzle across the keyboard while letting out controlled bursts of air. Keep the nozzle 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) above the keyboard at all times.[3]

- Compressed air is often available at office supply stores, electronics shops, and general stores. You can also order canisters online.
- To fully clean the keyboard, blow at it from different angles. Face it towards you at first, then rotate it to either side.
- If you're cleaning a laptop or membrane keyboard, try holding it as you blow it out. Keep it tilted at about a 75-degree angle so it isn't completely vertical.

4 - Use a dust vacuum to sweep up hard to remove debris.
Use a dust vacuum to sweep up hard to remove debris. The suction power from a dust vacuum lifts away most stubborn debris stuck between the keys. If you don't have a dust vacuum with a hose, try using a regular vacuum with a brush attachment. Go over the entire keyboard, focusing particularly in the areas around the keys. Most of the tough debris gets wedged in there.[4]

- Make sure none of your keys are loose, especially on a laptop. If a key comes off, retrieve it from the vacuum, wash it off, and slide it back into place. Fit it over the key stem or clip to bind it to the keyboard again.

5 - Clean around the keys with a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol.
Clean around the keys with a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol. Dampen the cotton swab very lightly to avoid getting too much moisture underneath the keys. Wipe around each individual key to remove leftover dust, oils, and other grime. Repeat this a few times as needed to clean the sides of each key and the space around it. Swap out swabs as they get dirty.[5]

- Isopropyl alcohol dries very quickly, so it is a better option than water. You can get it at most drug stores and general stores.
- Another cleaning option is to wrap a microfiber cloth around a knife. Moisten it with isopropyl alcohol, then push it down into the keyboard's grooves. This works best for mechanical keyboards with raised keys.
- Be cautious when working on a laptop. Isopropyl alcohol is still a great cleaning choice, but the laptop's delicate hardware is right underneath the keyboard. Don't let moisture drip underneath the keys.

6 - Scrub the keyboard with a cloth dampened in isopropyl alcohol.
Scrub the keyboard with a cloth dampened in isopropyl alcohol. Choose a lint-free cloth or paper towel to avoid introducing new debris. Make sure the cloth isn't dripping at all after you dampen it. Wipe the top portion of each key to clear away the remaining dust and other debris.[6]

- Watch out for frequently used keys like the space bar and enter key. These spots tend to have more grime. You may need to scrub them multiple times to clean them.
- For very dirty areas, use a toothpick to break through the grime. Hold the toothpick almost flat against the key and rub the grime to loosen it. Scrub the rest off with isopropyl alcohol.

7 - Polish the keyboard with a lint-free cloth.
Polish the keyboard with a lint-free cloth. Wipe the keyboard one last time to remove lingering dust and excess moisture. Check it to make sure it looks fresh and new. If it's still dirty, consider taking it apart to give it a deep cleaning. When you're done, plug the keyboard in and give it a test run.[7]

- Any isopropyl alcohol on the keyboard dries within about a minute. Water takes longer. If you used water or think moisture got into the keyboard, let it dry out for as long as 24 hours before plugging it back in.
