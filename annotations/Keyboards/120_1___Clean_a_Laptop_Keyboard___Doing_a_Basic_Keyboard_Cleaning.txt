1 - Turn off and unplug your laptop before you do any cleaning.
Turn off and unplug your laptop before you do any cleaning. Even though you won’t be putting liquids directly onto your laptop, you should turn the power off completely to make sure nothing gets damaged if a little moisture does get inside. Shut the laptop down through the Power Options menu, then remove the power cord.[1]

2 - Tilt the laptop upside down and gently tap or shake it.
Tilt the laptop upside down and gently tap or shake it. This will dislodge any big dust bunnies, crumbs, or other debris that’s hiding in your keyboard crevices. By getting the big stuff out first, it will be easier to do more detailed cleaning later on.[2]

3 - Spray between the keys with compressed air to remove dust.
Spray between the keys with compressed air to remove dust. Make sure the straw is attached to the can of compressed air before you use it. Tilt the keyboard to one side and spray between the keys in short bursts, moving from one side of the keyboard to the other. The force of the air will dislodge any debris that’s trapped between and beneath the keys.[3]

- You can find compressed air at stores that sell home and office supplies.
- Never spray the compressed air while you’re holding the can upside down, as this can cause propellant to get into the keyboard, damaging the components inside.

4 - Wipe down the keys with a damp microfiber cloth.
Wipe down the keys with a damp microfiber cloth. Microfiber is great at attracting dust, so a quick swipe over the keys can help remove some of the grime that has built up on your keyboard. If you need to, you can lightly dampen the cloth with a little water, but be sure to wring it out completely and only clean the tops of the keys so you don't get moisture inside of the laptop.[4]

5 - Remove stubborn grime with a cotton ball dipped in isopropyl alcohol.
Remove stubborn grime with a cotton ball dipped in isopropyl alcohol. Alcohol evaporates quickly, making it a safer alternative to using water on your laptop. In addition, alcohol is especially good at removing the oily residue left by your fingers. Just be sure to always apply the alcohol to the cotton ball first, and never pour it directly onto the keyboard.[5]

6 - Kill germs by wiping down the keys with a disinfecting wipe.
Kill germs by wiping down the keys with a disinfecting wipe. If you're concerned about germs, like after you've gotten over a cold or if you're using a shared computer, you can run a disinfecting wipe over the surface of the keys. However, do not use wipes with bleach in them, as these can damage the protective coating on the keys.[6]
