1 - Switch off the computer and disconnect the keyboard.
Switch off the computer and disconnect the keyboard. Protect both your hardware and yourself by taking care of any electrical components. Shut off your computer first, then unplug the keyboard from it. If you're using a wireless keyboard, remove the batteries.[13]

- Unplug the power cord if you're working on a laptop. Touch a key to make sure the computer is completely off.
- If you have a non-USB keyboard, always turn off the computer before unplugging the keyboard.

2 - Pull the keys off with a screwdriver if they are removable.
Pull the keys off with a screwdriver if they are removable. The keys on most modern keyboards fit over small clips and are easy to remove. Wedge a flathead screwdriver or butter knife underneath the corner of a key and lightly pry it up. Then, try to pull the key straight up with your fingers. You may need to wiggle it or pry up the opposite side to slide it off its clip.[14]

- Take a quick picture of the keyboard with your phone before pulling off the keys. It will help you put the keys back in the correct order later.
- For an easy way to remove keys, get a wire keycap puller. Find one online or at an electronics store.
- If you're unsure about removing keys, consult your owner's manual or call the manufacturer. Find out their recommendations for key removal and cleaning.

3 - Unscrew the keyboard and pull it apart if possible.
Unscrew the keyboard and pull it apart if possible. Flip the keyboard over and look for screws. Some keyboards consist of faceplates bound together. If the keyboard has screws, remove the bottom faceplate to wash it separately. Check for hidden screws underneath the keyboard's labels.[15]

- If you can't remove the keys, you usually can remove the faceplate. Take the keys off afterward, if possible, to give the faceplate a more thorough cleaning.

4 - Place the keys in a colander to wash them in warm water.
Place the keys in a colander to wash them in warm water. Set out a towel next to the sink. Run warm water from the faucet as you gather the keys into a colander. Then, hold the colander underneath running water, swirling the keys around by hand to rinse them. With a colander, most water and debris rinses off right away. When you're done, set the keys on a towel to finish drying.[16]

- If rinsing isn't enough to clean the keys, try using a liquid dish soap. Fill a bowl with warm water, then mix in 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of dish soap to create soapy water. Denture tablets are also very effective and can be used in place of soap.

5 - Wash the empty faceplate with soap and warm water.
Wash the empty faceplate with soap and warm water. Move the faceplate into a colander or bowl. Try rinsing it out with warm water. Clear out stubborn debris with soapy water and a microfiber cloth. When you're done, set the faceplate aside to dry.[17]

- If your keyboard is very grimy, soak the faceplate and keys in soapy water for up to 6 hours. Scrub and rinse off everything when you're done.

6 - Wipe the other half of the keyboard with a cloth and isopropyl alcohol.
Wipe the other half of the keyboard with a cloth and isopropyl alcohol. Dampen a clean, lint-free cloth with isopropyl alcohol. Scrub the remaining faceplate to clear out as much debris as possible. Go around the stems that normally hold the keys in place.[18]

- Make sure the cloth isn't dripping or else some of the moisture may reach the electronic components. Use an electronics cleaning brush from a general store to help remove tough debris.

7 - Clean the key stems with cotton swabs dipped in isopropyl alcohol.
Clean the key stems with cotton swabs dipped in isopropyl alcohol. Finish cleaning out the keyboard by wiping away the remaining debris. The key stems are the little towers or clips perched on top of the keyboard. Wipe around the stems to remove debris on the faceplate. Then, dampen a cotton swab with a drop of cleaning solution to wipe off the top of each stem.[19]

- Change out the cotton swabs as they get dirty to avoid leaving any debris behind.
- Isopropyl alcohol dries quickly, so it's safer to use than water. Avoid using a lot of it. Dampen each swab lightly.

8 - Let the keyboard dry for 2 to 3 days.
Let the keyboard dry for 2 to 3 days. Find a place on your countertop to put the computer parts. Lay out some towels, then arrange the components over them. Keep the parts exposed to fresh air to dry them out.
- Make sure the computer parts are in a secure spot so they don't fall on the floor or get lost. Keep them inaccessible to children or pets so they dry out fully.

9 - Replace the keyboard parts and test it.
Replace the keyboard parts and test it. Reassemble the keyboard by reversing the steps you took when taking it apart. For most keyboards, you will need to connect the faceplates first. Screw them back together, then set the keys on top of the clips or stems. Usually, all you have to do is slide the keys onto the clips to snap them in place.[20]
