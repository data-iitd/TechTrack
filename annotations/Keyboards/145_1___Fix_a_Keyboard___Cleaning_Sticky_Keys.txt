0 - Cleaning Sticky Keys

1 - Unplug the keyboard from your computer.
Unplug the keyboard from your computer. If you’re using a Bluetooth keyboard, turn it off or remove the batteries if you can so you don’t accidentally shock yourself while you’re using it. If you have a corded keyboard, unplug the USB cord from your computer so it doesn’t have power anymore.[10]

2 - Slide a flathead screwdriver underneath the key that’s sticking to pop it out.
Slide a flathead screwdriver underneath the key that’s sticking to pop it out. Position the end of a flathead screwdriver on any side of the key you want to remove. Carefully slide the screwdriver underneath the key so you lift it up. Gently lower the screwdriver handle to raise the key away from the keyboard and pop it out of place. Repeat the process for any additional keys that you need to remove from the keyboard.[11]

- You can also use a butter knife or another flat, blunt object if you don’t have a screwdriver with you.
- Some keyboards may have keys that are inset deeper, so they may be more difficult to remove, but you can still get underneath them with a screwdriver.

3 - Wipe the area under the key with a cotton swab soaked with rubbing alcohol.
Wipe the area under the key with a cotton swab soaked with rubbing alcohol. Dip the end of a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and shake off any excess liquid so it doesn’t drip too much. Scrub the area underneath the key with the cotton swab, focusing on any areas where you notice dirt or sticky residue from spills. Work the cotton swab into the hole on the keyboard as well since it could also be sticky.[12]

- Rubbing alcohol evaporates quickly so it won’t damage your keyboard when you clean with it.
- If you can’t fit a cotton swab into the spot on the keyboard, lay a paper towel over the area and press down on it with the end of your screwdriver to wipe the keyboard clean.

4 - Clean the bottom of the key you pulled out to remove any dirt.
Clean the bottom of the key you pulled out to remove any dirt. Check the bottom of the key you pulled out to see if it has any dust or sticky residue on it. Use your cotton swab with rubbing alcohol to wipe around the bottom of the key so it doesn’t stick down when you press it. Set the key face-up on a piece of paper towel to let it dry completely.[13]

- Clean the key even if it doesn’t feel sticky on the bottom since it may still stick inside the keyboard.

5 - Let the rubbing alcohol dry completely before popping the key back in.
Let the rubbing alcohol dry completely before popping the key back in. Wait for about 5 minutes for the rubbing alcohol to evaporate and dry on your keyboard. Set the key back into place and press down on it firmly so it snaps back into the keyboard. Test pressing the key multiple times to see if your keyboard functions properly.[14]

- If your key is still sticky, try removing it and some of the other keys around it to clean more thoroughly.
- If the key is unresponsive when you press it, then there may be a problem with the circuits.
