1 - Choose a retractable tray if you don’t want it to extend out from your desk.
Choose a retractable tray if you don’t want it to extend out from your desk. Retractable keyboard drawers slide underneath your desktop to keep your keyboard out of the way when you aren’t using it. These work great if you have limited space or if you want to prevent dust from getting on your keyboard. Look for trays online or at your local office supply store.[1]

- Keyboard trays usually cost around $50–100 USD, but they may cost more if you get a larger tray.

2 - Mark the holes for the tray’s mounting track on the bottom of your desk.
Mark the holes for the tray’s mounting track on the bottom of your desk. Look for the mounting track that came with your tray, which looks like a long flat piece with grooved edges. Position the track underneath your desk so it’s perpendicular to and 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) in from the desk’s front edge. Make sure the closed end of the track points toward the back of the desk or else you won’t be able to slide the tray in later on. Draw a dot in each of the track’s screw holes with a pencil or marker so you know where to attach it.[2]

- If your desk already has pre-drilled holes underneath, you can use them instead and won’t have to mark pilot holes.
- If your tray comes with 2 different lengths of track, pick the longest one that fits on your desk to help support your keyboard’s weight better.

3 - Drill pilot holes that are 1⁄8 in (0.32 cm) thick on each of your marks.
Drill pilot holes that are 1⁄8 in (0.32 cm) thick on each of your marks. Secure a 1⁄8 in (0.32 cm) bit onto your drill so you can make your holes. Hold the drill so it’s perpendicular to the bottom of your desk and lined up with one of the marks you drew. Keep the bit straight as you drill 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) into your desk. Keep drilling holes on every other mark you made.[3]

- Be careful not to drill completely through your desk when you make your pilot holes.
- If you don’t pre-drill pilot holes, you could damage or split the wood when you try screwing something in.

4 - Screw the track to the bottom of your desk with a screwdriver.
Screw the track to the bottom of your desk with a screwdriver. Hold the track underneath your desk again so the holes on the track line up with the ones you just drilled. Tighten the screws that came with the tray in the pilot holes using a screwdriver. Make sure the track presses tightly against the bottom of the desk so it doesn’t wobble around or come loose.[4]

- Stop turning the screw when you feel resistance so you don’t overtighten or strip them.

5 - Slide the tray’s mount into grooves on the track.
Slide the tray’s mount into grooves on the track. Look for the mounting plate on the tray’s mounting arm, which looks like a flat square attached to a hinge. Guide the mounting plate into the grooves on the sides of the track and push the mount in.[5]

- The mount will fit loosely inside the track so you can easily push it in and pull it out from your desk.

6 - Snap the guard onto the front of the track so the mount doesn’t fall off.
Snap the guard onto the front of the track so the mount doesn’t fall off. Look for a solid rectangular piece that’s the same width as the mounting track. Push the front guard onto the front of the track until you hear it click into place. That way, the mount won’t fall out when you pull it toward the front of the desk.[6]

- The back of the track will already have a guard so you don’t have to worry about putting one there.

7 - Attach the tray onto the mount with screws to secure it in place.
Attach the tray onto the mount with screws to secure it in place. Set the tray down on top of the mount’s front panel so the screw holes line up with one another. Use the screws that came with the kit to secure the tray onto the mount. Tighten the screws evenly so the tray doesn’t wobble or shift while you’re typing.[7]

- Most keyboard trays come with adhesive covers that you can place over the screwheads so they don’t damage your keyboard. They also prevent your keyboard from slipping around on the tray!
