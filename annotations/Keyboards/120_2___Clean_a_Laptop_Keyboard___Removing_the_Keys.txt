0 - Removing the Keys

1 - Search for your laptop model online to find out if the keys come off.
Search for your laptop model online to find out if the keys come off. On some laptop models, the keycaps can be gently pried off, giving you access to the surface beneath the keys. However, the keycaps on some laptops are permanently attached. Do an online search to determine if, and how, the keys can be removed.

2 - Remove the keys only if you really need to clean underneath them.
Remove the keys only if you really need to clean underneath them. Even if they're removable, keycaps are held in place by small plastic tabs that can break easily. To avoid damaging your keyboard, you should avoid removing your keys unless your keyboard is especially grimy.[7]

3 - Take a picture of the keys before you remove them.
Take a picture of the keys before you remove them. This will ensure you don't forget where the keys go when it's time to put them back! While it might be easy to remember the order of the number and letter keys, your keyboard likely has special characters and function keys, and it can be easy to get these confused.[8]

4 - Pry off the keys with a small, flat tool.
Pry off the keys with a small, flat tool. Slip the edge of the tool beneath the bottom of the key and gently pry upwards. The keycap should pop off easily. If it doesn't, don't force it, or you might permanently damage your keyboard.[9]

- Be sure to place the keycaps in a shallow bowl or another container so you don't accidentally lose them.
- You can purchase a toolkit from an electronics supply store that comes equipped with small plastic or metal pieces that are perfect for slipping beneath your laptop keys. If you don't have one of these, you can use a flathead screwdriver, a butter knife, or even your fingernail.

5 - Wipe beneath the keys with a microfiber cloth or a cotton swab dipped in alcohol.
Wipe beneath the keys with a microfiber cloth or a cotton swab dipped in alcohol. Since the inner workings of your laptop will be more exposed without the keycap in place, avoid using any liquid to clean under your keys. If you do have to tackle a sticky mess, dip a cotton swab in a little rubbing alcohol and carefully wipe away the spot.[10]
