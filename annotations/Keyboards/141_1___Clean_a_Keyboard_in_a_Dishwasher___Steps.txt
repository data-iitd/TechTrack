Dry the keyboard very thoroughly before plugging it in. This step is crucial to having a working keyboard.  Expect to wait two to five days, depending on your climate and method.  Since there are many crevices in the keyboard, turning the keyboard over once or twice a day and lightly shaking it during the drying will ensure that no pockets of water get trapped in the keyboard.

5 - Pop out the keys.
Pop out the keys. While not strictly required, popping out every key will help everything dry faster and more thoroughly. Do this only if you're sure you can put them all back correctly, including any special rods or springs.

- If you don't remove the keys, give the keyboard even more time to dry.
- You may be able to hasten drying, with or without keys, by placing the keyboard in front of a fan or someplace else where plenty of warm (not hot), dry air will circulate past it.

- It's possible to dismantle a keyboard even further if you pop the keys out first. There's often a plastic or rubber membrane under the keys that serves both as protection and spring.  If you don't want to try the dishwasher, try pulling the whole thing apart and seeing if you can clean just the parts you need.
- Want to wash just the keys? Pop them off and place them in a closed, mesh bag in the dishwasher. Take the opportunity to wipe out the space underneath them before you put everything back together.
- Plan to be without your keyboard for a few days while the keyboard dries. Most windows computers have an onscreen keyboard under accessories You can use the computer without a keyboard, use a different keyboard or computer, or simply be without the computer for a while.
