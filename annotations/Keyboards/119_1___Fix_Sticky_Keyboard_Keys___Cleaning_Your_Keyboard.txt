0 - Cleaning Your Keyboard

1 - Disconnect the keyboard from its power source.
Disconnect the keyboard from its power source. If you're using a laptop, this entails turning off and unplugging the laptop and removing its battery if possible. If you're using a standalone keyboard, unplugging it and/or removing the batteries will suffice.

2 - Spray the keyboard with compressed air.
Spray the keyboard with compressed air. Use the compressed air to blow any debris or dust out from the spaces between the keys and the keyboard base.
- Spritzing the compressed air around each key is a good idea; even if not all of the keys are stuck, this will prevent future sticking.

3 - Remove any remaining objects with a toothpick.
Remove any remaining objects with a toothpick. If any large objects (e.g., residue) remain visible near or under the keyboard's keys, use a toothpick to scrape away the objects.

4 - Wipe down your keyboard with isopropyl alcohol.
Wipe down your keyboard with isopropyl alcohol. Lightly spritz isopropyl alcohol onto a clean cloth, then run it from left to right across your keyboard's surface. This will help remove any gunk or sticky residue from around the keys.[1]

- If you don't have isopropyl alcohol, you can use water; however, make sure you pat dry your keyboard before proceeding if you do this.
- If your computer has a UV coating or a similar effect, do not use isopropyl alcohol as it will remove the coating. Use warm water instead.

5 - Test the keys.
Test the keys. Try pressing repeatedly the sticky keys. If they aren't still sticky, you can stop here; otherwise, continue with the rest of this method.

6 - Take a picture of your keyboard.
Take a picture of your keyboard. Before you remove any keys, photograph your keyboard so that you know which keys go where.

7 - Remove the sticky keys from the keyboard.
Remove the sticky keys from the keyboard. If you're using a mechanical keyboard (e.g., a desktop keyboard), use a keycap puller if you have one; otherwise, you can wrap floss around the base of the key and gently pull upward. You may also have to resort to a flat-head screwdriver to pry up the keys.
- If you have a laptop, refer to your laptop's manual or online documentation for instructions on removing the keys (in most cases, you'll pry the keys up from a specific point to avoid breaking their latches).
- If you have a MacBook laptop, you can remove the key(s) by prying it/them up from the top of the key(s).
- Most debris is found in the letters and numbers. Other keys tend to be less dirty and more difficult to replace after removal, especially the space bar.[2]

8 - Clean under the keys.
Clean under the keys. Use compressed air to remove exposed dust and debris, and a Q-tip or cloth dampened with isopropyl alcohol to remove stickiness and stains.
- For laptop keyboards and other keyboards with delicate internal parts, use gentle swabbing with a Q-tip only.

9 - Wash and dry the keys.
Wash and dry the keys. If the underside of your keys are discolored or dirty, put them in a colander and run water over them, or rub them in a bucket of soapy water. Let them air dry completely on a paper towel.

10 - Re-lubricate a mechanical keyboard's keys.
Re-lubricate a mechanical keyboard's keys. If you have a mechanical keyboard, press down on the sticky key's lever and apply a drop of lubricant to the walls of the key's well, then release and press the lever a few times to incorporate the lubricant.
- Make sure they lubricant you're using is specifically designed for keyboards or other sensitive plastics. Using a standard lubricant such as WD-40 may ruin the keyboard.
- This is only necessary if the mechanical keyboard's lever(s) is/are still sticking after your cleaning.

11 - Let your keyboard dry for at least two days before using it.
Let your keyboard dry for at least two days before using it. Once your keyboard is bone-dry, you can proceed with reassembling it, plugging it back into your computer, and testing it out.[3]
