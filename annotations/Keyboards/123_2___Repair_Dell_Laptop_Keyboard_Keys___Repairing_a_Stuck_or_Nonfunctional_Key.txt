0 - Repairing a Stuck or Nonfunctional Key

1 - Turn off and unplug your computer.
Turn off and unplug your computer. This reduces the chance of damage to you and your computer.

2 - Lever out the key with a screwdriver.
Lever out the key with a screwdriver. Remove the stuck key with a small, flat head screwdriver. Start by lifting each corner of the key, listening and feeling for a snap as it unhooks. Repeat with each corner until the key is removed, after two to four snaps.[2]

- Use light pressure only. If the key doesn't pop out, try a different corner.
- To remove larger keys, such as the Shift key and Space bar, lever from the top of the key (the side nearest the laptop screen).

3 - Look for dirt or small objects.
Look for dirt or small objects. These can cause the key to stick. Remove small objects with a pair of tweezers. Remove loose dust or animal fur with compressed air or a gentle vacuum cleaner hose attachment.

4 - Clean up spills.
Clean up spills. If you've spilled materials on the keyboard, remove the residue with a lint-free cloth. Dampen the cloth with a small amount of rubbing alcohol and wipe the sticky area gently. Leave the key cap off until the rubbing alcohol has fully evaporated and the area is dry.

5 - Examine the retaining clip.
Examine the retaining clip. The retaining clip, most often made out of white plastic, consists of two thin, square objects hooked around each other. These should be firmly attached to the keyboard, and to each other. If they are not, remove the clip by gently twisting the corners free with a screwdriver. See below for detailed instructions on replacing them.

6 - Check the silicone rubber membrane.
Check the silicone rubber membrane. This nipple-shaped membrane sits beneath the center of the key. Confirm that it is standing up, and try to depress it with a very gentle touch from a clean, soft object. If it sticks in the down position instead of popping back up, it needs cleaning or replacement.
- Do not touch it with a dirty or sharp object. This part of the keyboard is easily damaged.
- Clean with a lint-free cloth dampened slightly with rubbing alcohol. Pat with extreme care and wait for it to dry.

7 - Glue down a new membrane.
Glue down a new membrane. Before you begin, realize that this is a risky fix, and could ruin the key if you use too much glue. For a more reliable repair, take the keyboard to a computer repair professional to replace the entire keyboard. If you do decide to try this yourself, do so as follows:
- 
- Very carefully remove a membrane from a key you don't use by levering it off with a sharp knife.[3]

-  It is very easy to damage the membrane this way, but this is usually your only source of replacement membranes.
- Use a toothpick to place a dab of strong glue, such as silicone adhesive, onto a sheet of paper.
- Pick up the membrane with tweezers and lower it onto the sheet of paper, then transfer it onto the keyboard.
- Let sit for at least 30 minutes, or according to adhesive label instructions.
- Reattach the retainer and key cap on top of this, and let sit another 20 minutes before using.
