0 - Treating Liquid Spills

1 - Turn off the computer and unplug the keyboard right away.
Turn off the computer and unplug the keyboard right away. Deactivate your hardware as soon as you notice the spill. The liquid may seep down into the keyboard, damaging it or the internal components of a laptop if you have one. Disconnect the keyboard cable if you have a wired keyboard or the power supply if you have a laptop.[8]

- To prevent damage to your computer or keyboard, treat spills right away. Liquid and electrical parts are a bad combination. Don't reactivate the machine until it is dry.
- Turn off the computer first before unplugging a non-USB keyboard to prevent damage to the hardware.

2 - Turn the keyboard upside down to shake out the liquid.
Turn the keyboard upside down to shake out the liquid. Bring the keyboard to a sink, trash bag, or towel. Holding it upside down forces the liquid to drip back out instead of going deeper into the keyboard. Shaking it helps force out stubborn drops caught between the keys. Continue doing this until the keyboard stops dripping.[9]

- Tilt the keyboard around to help draw out the liquid. If you have a laptop, direct the liquid to the keyboard to keep it away from the motor and other vital parts. Keep the laptop open and upside down, tilting it towards you to force the liquid towards the keys and out.

3 - Dry the keyboard with a microfiber cloth.
Dry the keyboard with a microfiber cloth. Hold the keyboard upside down while you do this. Blot away as much liquid as you can. Don't turn the keyboard over until you have mopped up as much of the spill as possible.[10]

- Paper towels and tissues leave behind debris, so always use a lint-free cloth if possible. During an emergency, you may not have the opportunity to hunt down the correct cloth, so grab the best thing you have available. A dish towel, paper towels, or even an old T-shirt will do.

4 - Let the keyboard air dry for at least 24 hours.
Let the keyboard air dry for at least 24 hours. Keep the keyboard upside down to drain any moisture still inside of it. Place a towel underneath it to catch anything that comes out. Once the keyboard has had a chance to dry, you can safely turn it over.[11]

- Most spills dry up within about 24 hours. If you have time to spare, let the keyboard air out for possibly 2 or 3 days.

5 - Test the keyboard for sticky keys and other signs of damage.
Test the keyboard for sticky keys and other signs of damage. Plug the keyboard back in if it's wired or turn on your laptop. Try typing with the keyboard. Press down on all of the keys to make sure they work. You may need to pull off individual keys to wash them.[12]

- Unless you spilled plain water, chances are some of the keys will be sticky. Take apart the keyboard to give it a deep cleaning.
- Consider getting a professional cleaning for an expensive laptop. Laptops are much more delicate and difficult to clean than regular keyboards. A professional can check the internal components of your laptop for damage.
