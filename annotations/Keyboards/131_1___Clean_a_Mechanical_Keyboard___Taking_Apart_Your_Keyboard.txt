0 - Taking Apart Your Keyboard

1 - Remove all the keycaps.
Remove all the keycaps. Use a tool called a keycap puller (that looks like a little pair of wire tongs) to remove all of the keycaps from your keyboard. Simply push down on each keycap with the puller and then pull back. This should remove each individual keycap.[3]

- Try to keep the keycaps sorted so that they are easy to reapply. You might consider keeping all of the keycaps from the right side sorted together and all the keycaps from the left side sorted together.

2 - Wash keycaps.
Wash keycaps. Take off all of the keycaps and wash them using a gentle dish soap and warm water on a paper towel. Be sure to remove any sticky residue or dirt from each key as you wash them.[4]

- You can also submerge the keycaps in a bowl containing a solution of warm water and denture cleaning tablets. Let the keycaps soak and then wipe them off.
- Let the keycaps dry completely before attempting to reattach them to your mechanical keyboard. This could take 1-2 days.

3 - Dump the contents outside.
Dump the contents outside. Take your mechanical keyboard outside. Turn it upside down and dump all of the dirt and debris onto the ground. Be careful not to shake out any of the internal pieces from your mechanical keyboard, but shake it hard enough to get out most of the debris.[5]

- You could dump it into the trash, but then you risk all of the debris flying around and settling elsewhere in your home.
- You can also spray some compressed canned air on the keyboard while it’s upside down to get rid of some of the extra grime.

4 - Clean the keyboard with a pipe cleaner and alcohol.
Clean the keyboard with a pipe cleaner and alcohol. Dampen a pipe cleaner with some rubbing alcohol and gently run the pipe cleaner along the dismantled keyboard. Be careful not to use too much alcohol so it doesn’t drip on the keyboard components.[6]

- Be sure to let the remnants of the rubbing alcohol dry completely before you put your mechanical keyboard back together and plug it back in. This could cause your keyboard to short out and ruin it.

5 - Reassemble the keyboard.
Reassemble the keyboard. Once you have cleaned the keyboard and let it (and the keycaps) dry completely, it’s time to put the mechanical keyboard back together. Snap each keycap back into place until you have reassembled the entire façade of the keyboard.
- Make sure you position the keycaps back in the correct place – you may want to consult a diagram of a qwerty keyboard before beginning.
