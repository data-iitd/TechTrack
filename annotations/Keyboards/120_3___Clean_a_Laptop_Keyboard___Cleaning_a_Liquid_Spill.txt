0 - Cleaning a Liquid Spill

1 - Turn off the power to your laptop and remove the battery immediately.
Turn off the power to your laptop and remove the battery immediately. Disconnect the power cord right away and hold down the power button until your laptop goes off. If liquid touches the electrical components inside of your computer, it can be permanently damaged. By working quickly, you’ll help minimize the risk of electrical damage.[11]

- If the laptop starts to smoke or steam, or you see bubbling or bulging, don't touch it. You could be seriously burned or suffer an electrical shock.[12]

- Even if you get the laptop dry, residue from sugary, acidic, or alcoholic drinks may still be present, and that residue may affect the functionality of your keyboard in the future.

2 - Turn the laptop upside down over a towel.
Turn the laptop upside down over a towel. Open the laptop as wide as you can, turn it face down, and set it on top of a towel or another absorbent material. By flipping the laptop over, you are allowing gravity to pull the moisture away from the motherboard and other electrical components.[13]

3 - Blot away as much of the liquid as you can right away.
Blot away as much of the liquid as you can right away. If you have a microfiber or lint-free cloth on hand, use that to dry the laptop. However, you’re racing against time, so if you don’t have one of those handy, just grab whatever is closest to you, whether that’s a dish towel, paper towels, or even an old T-shirt. Dry any liquid that you can see on the surface of the laptop.[14]

4 - Leave your laptop propped up to dry for 1-2 days.
Leave your laptop propped up to dry for 1-2 days. There’s no way to rush this process. Even if the laptop looks dry from the outside, moisture could be trapped inside. To be safe, give the keyboard a minimum of 24 hours to dry before you try to turn it on again.[15]

5 - Take your laptop for professional cleaning if the liquid was sugary.
Take your laptop for professional cleaning if the liquid was sugary. If you splashed a little water into the keyboard, you're probably fine, but if you spilled a large, sugary drink and it's an expensive laptop, consider having a professional break down your laptop and clean inside. Professional cleaning can run upward of $500, but it can be worth it if you have a lot of money invested in your laptop.[16]

- If you're familiar with electronics, you can take it apart yourself and clean inside, but some laptops can only be dismantled with special tools that you might not have on hand.

6 - Replace the battery and turn on the laptop once it's dried completely.
Replace the battery and turn on the laptop once it's dried completely. This will be the moment of truth. If your laptop doesn’t work at all, give it another 24 hours to dry out. If your operating system boots up but the keyboard doesn't work, you can replace the keyboard or use a USB keyboard.[17]
