1 - Understand the process.
Understand the process. EXE files are not designed for OS X, so you'll need to use special software to get them to run. You'll be installing the open-source "wine" utility, which adds a Windows "wrapper" to the EXE file, giving it access to the essential Windows files that it needs to run. The wine utility does not work with every Windows EXE file, and some programs work better than others. You do not need a Windows disc to install wine.

2 - Download and install Xcode from the Mac App Store.
Download and install Xcode from the Mac App Store. This is a free development tool that is required in order to compile software code. You won't be using it directly, but the tools you'll be installing to open EXE files relies on it. 
- Start Xcode after you finish downloading it, and click the "Xcode" menu. Select "Preferences" and then click the "Downloads" tab. Click the Install button next to "Command Line Tools".

3 - Download and install MacPorts.
Download and install MacPorts. This is a free utility that simplifies the compiling process, which you'll be using to build your version of wine. You can download MacPorts from macports.org/install.php. Click the link for the version of OS X that you are using, and then double-click the .pkg file that is downloaded to your computer to install MacPorts.

4 - Open the Terminal.
Open the Terminal. You'll need to use the Terminal to adjust some of MacPorts' settings. You can open the Terminal from the Utilities folder.

5 - Copy and paste the following command.
Copy and paste the following command. Paste this command into the Terminal window and press Return: 
- echo export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:\$PATH$'\n'export MANPATH=/opt/local/man:\$MANPATH | sudo tee -a /etc/profile

6 - Enter your admin password.
Enter your admin password. You will be prompted for your admin password before the command can run. You won't see anything as you type the password. Press Return after you have finished typing the password. If you don't have a password associated with the admin account, the process will fail.

7 - Copy and paste the following command.
Copy and paste the following command. This command will tell MacPorts whether or not you have a 64-bit system. Paste the following command and press Return: 
- if [ `sysctl -n hw.cpu64bit_capable` -eq 1 ] ; then echo "+universal" | sudo tee -a /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf; else echo "n/a"; fi

8 - Enter the command to agree to the Xcode license.
Enter the command to agree to the Xcode license. This quick command will tell Xcode that you agree to the license agreement, allowing you to compile code. Close and reopen the Terminal window after running this command: 
- sudo xcodebuild -license

9 - Enter the command to install wine.
Enter the command to install wine. Once you've reopened the Terminal window, you can start installing wine. You may be prompted for the admin password again. The installation process may take a while to complete. You'll know that it's finished when you are returned to the Terminal input: 
- sudo port install wine

10 - Navigate to the location of the EXE file.
Navigate to the location of the EXE file. Use the cd command to navigate to the location that your EXE file is stored on your Mac. You'll need to do this through the Terminal.

11 - Use wine to run the EXE file.
Use wine to run the EXE file. Enter the following command to run an EXE file that's in your current directory. Replace fileName with the actual file's name: 
- wine fileName.exe

12 - Use the program as you normally would.
Use the program as you normally would. If the EXE file is a standalone program, you'll be able to start using it immediately. If it's a setup file for a program, you'll be able to proceed through the installation prompts as if you were using Windows. 
- Not every program works with wine. For a full list of compatible programs, visit appdb.winehq.org.

13 - Open programs that have been installed.
Open programs that have been installed. If you used an EXE file to install a program, you'll need to use wine to run the installed program file. 
- Type cd ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/ to open the Program Files directory that your wine programs are installed to.
- Type ls to see a list of all of your installed programs. Type cd programName to open a program's directory. If the program's directory has a space, you'll need to include a \ before the space. For example, Microsoft Office would be cd Microsoft\ Office.
- Type ls again in the program's directory to find the EXE file.
- Type wine fileName.exe to run the program.

14 - Install the Mono libraries if the program requires .NET.
Install the Mono libraries if the program requires .NET. .NET is a software library for many Windows programs, and Mono is the open-source replacement that wine can use. you only need to install this if your programs require .NET.[2]
