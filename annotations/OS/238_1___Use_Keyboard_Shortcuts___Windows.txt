- Ctrl - Usually found on the left and right sides of the keyboard. The right Ctrl key will be just left of the arrow keys.
- Alt - Found on the left and right sides of the keyboard, farther in toward the center of the keyboard than Ctrl.
- ⇧ Shift - Symbolized by an upward-facing arrow, this key is on the left and right sides of the keyboard.
- Fn - The "function" key allows you to use secondary functions of other keys. Commands that use the function keys (e.g., F8) may require use of the Fn key.
- ⊞ Win - This key displays the Windows logo, and is normally in the bottom-left side of your keyboard.
- Arrow keys - While not technically modifier keys, the arrow keys can be used to select items.
- ↵ Enter - This key allows you to open a selected item. It's essentially a mouse left-click.
