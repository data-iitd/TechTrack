3 - First, of all we will remove and disable other vendor versions of Java so there is no system conflict with multiple versions of Java.Let's assume you have OpenJDK installed on your system if so we are going to remove OpenJDK by issuing the following commands

7 - Second, we will disable Oracle Java if it is installed by editing the _etc_profile system PATH.In this exercise we will comment out the references to Oracle Java in the  system wide _etc_profile file

Second, we will disable Oracle Java if it is installed by editing the /etc/profile system PATH.In this exercise we will comment out the references to Oracle Java in the  system wide /etc/profile file

8 - I also recommend deleting the Oracle Java folders if you have them so they do not cause system conflicts.For example if you have Oracle Java installed in _usr_local_java follow these instructions to remove Oracle Java

I also recommend deleting the Oracle Java folders if you have them so they do not cause system conflicts.For example if you have Oracle Java installed in /usr/local/java follow these instructions to remove Oracle Java
- 
- Type/Copy/Paste: cd /usr/local/java
- Type/Copy/Paste: rm -rf jdk1.7.0
- Type/Copy/Paste: rm -rf jre1.7.0

9 - If Oracle Java is installed on your system you will comment out the references to Oracle Java in the _etc_profile, .profile or .bashrc file.
If Oracle Java is installed on your system you will comment out the references to Oracle Java in the /etc/profile, .profile or .bashrc file.

10 - For example, as root, use a text editor such as nano or gedit to edit your _etc_profile.
For example, as root, use a text editor such as nano or gedit to edit your /etc/profile. If you have references to the Oracle Java JDK/JRE in those files comment them out using the ## symbol.
- 
- Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s nano /etc/profile
- or
- Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s gedit /etc/profile

11 - You may have a file that looks like this:
You may have a file that looks like this:
- JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0
- PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
- JRE_HOME=/usr/local/java/jre1.7.0
- PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JRE_HOME/bin
- export JAVA_HOME
- export JRE_HOME
- export PATH

12 - You want to make sure you comment out the references to Oracle Java, using the ## symbol in your _etc_profile, .profile and .bashrc file so change the file to look like this:

14 - Download
Download the IBM Java 7.0 SDK and JRE
- Note in order to download IBM SDK/JRE you will have to be a registered user, following the provided links from the IBM website in order to register.

15 - Download the version of IBM Java SDK and JRE for your system architecture, in this case we are using the IBM Java SDK_JRE for 64 bit Ubuntu Linux, which is:
Download the version of IBM Java SDK and JRE for your system architecture, in this case we are using the IBM Java SDK/JRE for 64 bit Ubuntu Linux, which is:

16 - Once the IBM Java SDK and JRE has been downloaded you will proceed to set up a development environment for the IBM JDK and JRE.
Once the IBM Java SDK and JRE has been downloaded you will proceed to set up a development environment for the IBM JDK and JRE. Create a directory to hold the IBM Java SDK and JRE then we will move the downloaded IBM Java SDK and JRE, to /opt/ibm/java directory. Then we will unpack the Java SDK and JRE.

17 - Create a directory to hold the IBM Java SDK and JRE using the following command:

Also reload your system wide PATH /etc/profile by typing the following command:

29 - Type_Copy_Paste:
Type/Copy/Paste: . /etc/profile
- Note your system wide PATH /etc/profile file will reload after reboot of your Ubuntu Linux system

30 - Test to see if IBM Java installed correctly by using the command:
Test to see if IBM Java installed correctly by using the command:
- Type/Copy/Paste: java -version

31 - You should receive a message that displays:
You should receive a message that displays:
- java version "1.7.0-ea"

- J9CL - 20100522_58582)
- JCL - 20100514_02 based on Sun 7b76

32 - Test that your IBM Java compiler works by using the command:
Test that your IBM Java compiler works by using the command:
- 
- Type/Copy/Paste: javac -version
- You should receive a message that displays:
- javac 1.7.0-internal
- You can also switch between different installed vendors of Java, such as OpenJDK, Oracle and IBM by using the command:
- Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --config java
- Make sure you select the Java directory which references IBM Java and press enter.
- Reboot your Ubuntu Linux system so that your system can reload the /etc/profile system wide PATH file. Then you should be all set to run and develop IBM Java programs on your Ubuntu Linux system.
