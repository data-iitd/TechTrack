0 - Downloading the Ubuntu Installation File

1 - Open the Ubuntu website.
Open the Ubuntu website. Go to https://www.ubuntu.com/ in your computer's web browser. This is the official site for Ubuntu support and downloads.

2 - Select Downloads.
Select Downloads. It's a tab in the upper-right side of the window. Placing your mouse cursor on this tab prompts a drop-down menu.

3 - Click Desktop.
Click Desktop. You'll find this option in the Downloads drop-down menu.

4 - Click Download.
Click Download. This green button is to the right of the current version of Ubuntu. Doing so prompts the Ubuntu disk image (ISO) file to begin downloading onto your computer.
- You may have to click Save or select a download location before the Ubuntu ISO will download.

5 - Wait for the download to complete.
Wait for the download to complete. The Ubuntu ISO file is close to 2 gigabytes in size, so it may take a while to finish downloading; once it does, you can proceed with creating a new virtual machine for your Ubuntu installation.
