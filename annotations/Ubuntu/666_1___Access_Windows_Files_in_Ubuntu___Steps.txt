Having located the partition, write down the name – it will look something like /dev/hda2 or /dev/sda2, depending if your drives are PATA, SCSI or SATA.  Do this carefully – Now check to see if this is the partition by manually mounting it and looking at the files.

6 - Type the command.
Type the command. mount -t ntfs /dev/sda2 /mnt/windows -o "umask=022"

7 - Make sure you replace _dev_sda2 with the name of the windows partition you wrote down.
Make sure you replace /dev/sda2 with the name of the windows partition you wrote down.  Now access the mounted drive and ensure that you can read the files by going to Places → Computer and navigating to /mnt/windows.  If you can see your files, you are all set.  If not, you've mounted the wrong drive, unmount it using umount /dev/sda2, making sure that you use the correct name for your drive.
