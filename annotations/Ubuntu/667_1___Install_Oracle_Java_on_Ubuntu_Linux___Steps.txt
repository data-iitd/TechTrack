0 - Steps

1 - Check to see if your Ubuntu Linux operating system architecture is 32-bit or 64-bit, open up a terminal and run the following command below.
Check to see if your Ubuntu Linux operating system architecture is 32-bit or 64-bit, open up a terminal and run the following command below.
- Type/Copy/Paste: file /sbin/init
- Note the bit version of your Ubuntu Linux operating system architecture it will display whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit.

2 - Check if you have Java installed on your system.
Check if you have Java installed on your system. To do this, you will have to run the Java version command from terminal.
- Open up a terminal and enter the following command:
- Type/Copy/Paste: java -version
- If you have OpenJDK installed on your system it may look like this:
- java version "1.7.0_15"OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.10pre) (7b15~pre1-0lucid1) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0-b09, mixed mode)
- If you have OpenJDK installed on your system, you have the wrong vendor version of Java installed for this exercise.

3 - Completely remove the OpenJDK_JRE from your system and create a directory to hold your Oracle Java JDK_JRE binaries.
Completely remove the OpenJDK/JRE from your system and create a directory to hold your Oracle Java JDK/JRE binaries. This will prevent system conflicts and confusion between different vendor versions of Java. For example, if you have the OpenJDK/JRE installed on your system, you can remove it by typing the following at the command line:
- 
- Type/Copy/Paste: sudo apt-get purge openjdk-\*
- This command will completely remove OpenJDK/JRE from your system
- 
- Type/Copy/Paste: sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/java
- This command will create a directory to hold your Oracle Java JDK and JRE binaries.

4 - Download the Oracle Java JDK_JRE for Linux
Download the Oracle Java JDK/JRE for Linux. Make sure you select the correct compressed binaries for your system architecture 32-bit or 64-bit (which end in tar.gz).
- For example, if you are on Ubuntu Linux 32-bit operating system download 32-bit Oracle Java binaries.
- For example, if you are on Ubuntu Linux 64-bit operating system download 64-bit Oracle Java binaries.
- Optional, Download the Oracle Java JDK/JRE Documentation
- Select jdk-7u40-apidocs.zip
- 
- Important Information: 64-bit Oracle Java binaries do not work on 32-bit Ubuntu Linux operating systems, you will receive multiple system error messages, if you attempt to install 64-bit Oracle Java on 32-bit Ubuntu Linux.

5 - Copy the Oracle Java binaries into the _usr_local_java directory.
Copy the Oracle Java binaries into the /usr/local/java directory. In most cases, the Oracle Java binaries are downloaded to: /home/"your_user_name"/Downloads.

7 - Double-check your directories.
Double-check your directories. At this point, you should have one uncompressed binary directory in /usr/local/java for the Java JDK/JRE listed as:
- 
- Type/Copy/Paste: ls -a
- jdk1.7.0_45
- or jre1.7.0_45

8 - Edit the system PATH file _etc_profile and add the following system variables to your system path.

- 
- Type/Copy/Paste:  sudo gedit /etc/profile
- or
- Type/Copy/Paste:  sudo nano /etc/profile

9 - Scroll down to the end of the file using your arrow keys and add the following lines below to the end of your _etc_profile file:
Scroll down to the end of the file using your arrow keys and add the following lines below to the end of your /etc/profile file:
- 
- If you are installing the JDK then Type/Copy/Paste:JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0_45JRE_HOME=$JAVA_HOME/jrePATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$JRE_HOME/binexport JAVA_HOMEexport JRE_HOMEexport PATH

- Type/Copy/Paste: java -version. This command lets you know that you are now able to compile Java programs from the terminal. You should receive a message which displays: java 1.7.0_45

14 - Congratulations, you just installed Oracle Java on your Linux system.
Congratulations, you just installed Oracle Java on your Linux system. Now reboot your Ubuntu Linux system. Afterwards, your system will be fully configured for running and developing Java programs. Later on you may want to try compiling and running your own Java programs by following this article How to Create your First Java Program on Ubuntu Linux
