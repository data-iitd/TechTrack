Download Edubuntu 14.04.2 LTS from the website. Depending on your internet speed, this could take some time. Here you will be able to choose over downloading the 64-bit ISO file (newer computers) or the 32-bit ISO file (almost all computers).

2 - Plug in the USB stick.
Plug in the USB stick. Again, you need to format this USB stick as FAT32. If you have any important files on your USB stick, back them up now.

3 - Launch the software.
Launch the software.
- On Ubuntu, you can open the Dash and enter "startup disk creator" or "unetbootin" depending on what you want to use.
- On Windows or Mac, search for "unetbootin" and select it when the rocket with the title UNetBootin shows up.

4 - Configure the software to install the Edubuntu image you downloaded.
Configure the software to install the Edubuntu image you downloaded. The process in UNetBootin and Startup Disk Creator are pretty much the same.
- In Startup Disk Creator, click the "others" button under Source disc image (.iso), navigate to the Downloads folder and select "edubuntu-14.04.4-dvd-[i386 or amd64].iso". Then, select the USB stick you want to use to install Edubuntu.
- In UNetBootin, click on the Diskimage radio button. Then, ensure that ISO is selected from the first drop-down menu and click the "..." button. Next, navigate to the downloads folder and open "edubuntu-14.04.4-dvd-[i386 or amd64].iso" as you would in Startup Disk Creator. Finally, make sure that Type is set to USB Drive and then select your USB stick from the Drive drop-down menu.

5 - Click "OK" in UNetBootin or "Make startup disk" in Startup Disk Creator.
Click "OK" in UNetBootin or "Make startup disk" in Startup Disk Creator. Your live USB is now being made. This may take a while to load depending on how fast your computer is.
