Instead, right click on your desktop, choose “New” and click on “Shortcut.” In the new window you will see a location field. Type in “The path to the vmware program” “-X” “The path to your virtual machine’s *.vmx file” The -X command tells the shortcut to open the program and to start the identified virtual machine. Be sure to use quotation marks as well. Click on “Next”. Provide a name for the shortcut then click on “Finish.”[4]
