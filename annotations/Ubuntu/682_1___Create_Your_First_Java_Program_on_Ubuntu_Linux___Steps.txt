- This will create your Java_Applications directory.

4 - Navigate to your Java_Applications directory.
Navigate to your Java_Applications directory.  Type or copy/paste: cd Java_Applications
- This will change you into your newly created Java_Applications directory.

5 - Use a text editor such as nano or gedit to create a java file.
Use a text editor such as nano or gedit to create a java file. In this example we will use the traditional first program known as “Hello world”. This will open up a blank Java text file to work with and now we will insert some text into our Java file.
- So using nano or gedit we will issue the following command: 
- Type: nano HelloWorld.java or type gedit HelloWorld.java

6 -  Enter the following code below.
Enter the following code below.
-
