7 - Install Oracle Java 8 (optional).
Install Oracle Java 8 (optional). If you want to use the latest version of Java provided by Oracle, you can install it yourself. Most users won't need to do this. OpenJDK 7 will handle virtually all normal Java operations. Oracle's Java is no longer included in the Ubuntu repository due to licensing issues, so you'll need to install it from another source. The OpenJDK version of Java 8 is not yet available without building it yourself.[3]

- Type sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer and press ↵ Enter. This will install the Java 8 runtime environment. You'll need to read and accept the license agreement.
