4 - Type sudo updatedb and press ↵ Enter.
Type sudo updatedb and press ↵ Enter.  This updates your database.

5 - Type locate openjdk and press ↵ Enter.
Type locate openjdk and press ↵ Enter.  This command is used to identify where is Java installed on your Ubuntu machine.
- If Java has not been installed, type sudo apt-get install openjdk-9-jre-headless -y and press ↵ Enter

6 - Look to see where Java is installed.
Look to see where Java is installed.  You can use the install location to set the Java_Home path.  For example, if most of the return outputs are "/usr/lib/jvm/java-9-openjdk-amd64", we would use this path to set the Java_Home pather.

7 - Type export JAVA_HOME= followed by the Java installation path.
Type export JAVA_HOME= followed by the Java installation path.  In our previous example, we would type export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-9-openjdk-amd64".  This temporarily sets the Java_Home path.  However, if the system is restarted, it will be lost.

8 - Press ↵ Enter.
Press ↵ Enter.  This executes the command.

9 - Type echo "JAVA_HOME=' followed by the installation path.
Type echo "JAVA_HOME=' followed by the installation path.  Using the above example, we would type echo "JAVA_HOME='/usr/lib/jvm/java-9-openjdk-amd64'".

10 - Add >> _etc_environment to the end of the line and press ↵ Enter.
Add >> /etc/environment to the end of the line and press ↵ Enter.  This permanently sets the Java_Home path.
- Alternatively, if you do not have root access, you can type echo "JAVA_HOME='java installation path'" >> .bashrc and press ↵ Enter to set the Java_Home path.[1]
