Confirm that the paper being used matches the type of paper designated under the paper settings options on the laser printer. This typically can be found on the printer's control panel listed under "printing preferences" or "advanced printer settings."

6 - Use the highest quality images and graphics available to achieve the best results when printing projects from a laser printer.
Use the highest quality images and graphics available to achieve the best results when printing projects from a laser printer. The resolution, or dots per inch (dpi), of the original image or graphic file will have a dramatic effect on the final product printed from a laser printer.
- Use images or graphics with a resolution of at least 2400 dpi to achieve the best results when printing from a laser printer.
- Determine the resolution of an image or graphic by right-clicking the file and selecting "Properties" from the pull-down menu. The image resolution will be listed among the information in the Properties dialogue box.

7 - Contact the contracted service technician.
Contact the contracted service technician. Certain commercial lease contracts require that a qualified service technician perform all maintenance tasks required for a laser printer. Printer maintenance contractors often will place a printed label with their contact information on the device.
