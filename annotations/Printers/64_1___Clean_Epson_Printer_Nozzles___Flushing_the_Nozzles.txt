0 - Flushing the Nozzles

1 - Unplug the power cable while a piece of paper is being printed.
Unplug the power cable while a piece of paper is being printed. Print out any sheet of paper from the printer to get the print head to start moving. While the sheet is being printed, unplug the printer so the print head remains free. Remove the sheet of paper from the printer so you can clean the nozzles.[9]

- Unplug the cable from the back of the printer so you can replace it easily later on.

2 - Open the top of the printer and slide the print head to the center.
Open the top of the printer and slide the print head to the center. Lift the top of the printer to expose the print head containing the ink cartridges. Slide the print head towards the center of the printer so you can easily clean the nozzles.[10]

- Because you cut off power while the printer was working, the print head will move freely on its rails.
- If you can’t move the print head, don’t force it. Plug in the printer, print out another sheet of paper, and cut off the power again to free it.

3 - Remove the ink cartridges and place blotting paper beneath the print head.
Remove the ink cartridges and place blotting paper beneath the print head. Grab the ink cartridges on from the top of the print head and pull them out to remove them. Set them aside so you can install them later. Cut 2 1 inch (2.5 cm) strips of blotting paper and place them beneath the printhead so they’re stacked on top of each other and can absorb any moisture during the cleaning process.[11]

- Use a pair of scissors to cut the strips of blotting paper.
- You can find blotting paper at department stores, craft stores, office supply stores, and online.
- Change your ink cartridges as soon as you get a low ink warning to keep clogs from forming.

4 - Fit a 1 inch (2.5 cm) silicone tube onto a 10 cc syringe.
Fit a 1 inch (2.5 cm) silicone tube onto a 10 cc syringe. Get a clean 10 cc injection syringe without a needle. Cut a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) length of a small silicone hose designed for model airplanes and slide it onto the end of the syringe. Make sure the hose fits snugly and won’t fall off.[12]

- Look for 1 inch (2.5 cm) silicone tubes at hobby shops, remote-controlled airplane shops, and online.
- You can find clean syringes at pharmacies, department stores, and online.

5 - Fill the syringe with isopropylic alcohol and connect it to the print head.
Fill the syringe with isopropylic alcohol and connect it to the print head. Insert the end of the silicone tube into the container of isopropylic alcohol. Slowly pull back on the plunger of the syringe to pull the alcohol out of the container until the syringe is full. Then, attach the end of the silicone hose onto the tube that goes inside of the ink cartridge on the top of the print head.[13]

- There are tubes for each of the ink cartridges, so you’ll need to flush each of them one by one.
- The silicone hose will fit snugly over the tube on the print head.
- Do not use rubbing alcohol or another cleaning solution which may contain water that will damage the print head.

6 - Push the plunger on the syringe to flush the printer nozzle.
Push the plunger on the syringe to flush the printer nozzle. With the silicone tube attached to the print head, slowly and gently push the plunger on the syringe to force the alcohol through the printer nozzle. If you feel resistance, wait a few moments to allow the alcohol to loosen any clogs, then continue to push. Flush all of the alcohol in the syringe through the nozzle.[14]

- Don’t try to force the alcohol through a clog or you could damage the nozzle.

7 - Remove and refill the syringe and connect it to another nozzle to flush it.
Remove and refill the syringe and connect it to another nozzle to flush it. When the syringe is empty, carefully remove it from the print head. Refill it completely with isopropylic alcohol and connect the silicone hose to another one of the ink cartridges tubes on top of the print head. Slowly and gently flush the alcohol through the nozzle. Continue flushing all of the nozzles on the print head so they’re clean.[15]

- You don’t need to flush the nozzles more than once to remove any buildup.

8 - Slide the print head to the right and remove the blotting paper.
Slide the print head to the right and remove the blotting paper. Once the nozzles have been flushed, move the print head back into position on the far right. Remove the damp blotting paper and throw it away. Wipe the area with a clean, dry cloth or paper towel to remove any moisture.[16]

9 - Replace the ink cartridges and turn the printer back on to test it.
Replace the ink cartridges and turn the printer back on to test it. Insert each of the ink cartridges into their appropriate slots on the top of the print head. Make sure they each click into place so they’re attached securely and close the top of the printer. Plug the printer back in and turn it on. Print out a test pattern or a sheet of paper with an image and check it out to see if the cleaning has improved the print quality.[17]
