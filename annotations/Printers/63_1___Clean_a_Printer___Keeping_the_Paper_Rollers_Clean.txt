Remove the paper tray to locate the paper rollers on an inkjet printer. Typically, you can find the paper rollers on an inkjet paper by simply lifting the paper tray away from the printer. The paper rollers are made of rubber and are about .5 inches (1.3 cm) wide.
- You may need to rotate the printer so that you are able to see the bottom, where the rollers are typically located.[4]

Locate the paper rollers in the access panel on a laser printer. The rollers might be near the paper tray, but they aren’t always. If you don’t see them, open the printer’s access panel, which can be found either on the front or back of your printer, depending on the model. You may need to remove the printer cartridge in order to access the rollers.[5]

- On laser printers, you might not be able to manually rotate the rollers. Don’t worry, you can easily unsnap the clips holding the rollers in place and remove them. Just put them pack and fasten the clips after you’ve wiped the rollers clean.
- Wipe the rollers dry with the dry part of the towel.

5 - Close the printer and print a test page to see if it works.
Close the printer and print a test page to see if it works. Your printer might automatically print a test page after you close the access panel or replace the paper tray. If not, check your manual to see how to print a test page.[8]
