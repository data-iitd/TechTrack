0 - Using the Hydra

1 - Use the 1, 2, 3, and 4 buttons.
Use the 1, 2, 3, and 4 buttons. These buttons are located on the face of each of the two controllers. These buttons are given numerical values for compatibility purposes, and the functions will depend on the game you’re playing.
- The numerical buttons on the left-hand controller are usually used as directional keys while the buttons on the right are used as action keys.

2 - Use the 5 button.
Use the 5 button. This button can be found on both controllers and is placed in between the numerical buttons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The 5 button usually works as the “Select” or “Start” button, or a way to access the game menu.

3 - Use the analog sticks.
Use the analog sticks. The analog sticks are located right at the middle and can be found on both controllers. The analog sticks are used as substitute to the 1 to 4 buttons, but its functions may still depend on the kind of game you’re playing.

4 - Use the “Bumper” and “Trigger” buttons.
Use the “Bumper” and “Trigger” buttons. These buttons can be found on the front side of the controllers, and just like the keys mentioned above, its functions will depend the on the game you’re playing.

5 - Use the motion-sense feature.
Use the motion-sense feature. At the lower part of the base station you’ll see a Razer logo. To properly use the motion-sense feature of the controller, the logo should be facing you. The logo must be in line right between the two controllers.
- This serves as a basic rule of thumb to properly align the base station, accurately using the motion sensing controllers.
