solar panel be make up of two type of silicon . sun shine on solar panel . sunlight go into the top half of the solar panel . sunlight travel into the bottom half of the solar panel . the `` jump '' between the two half can be use to make direct current . a solar `` inverter '' change the direct current to alternate current . alternate current can be use to power thing in you house .

fixation be the first step in the process of make nitrogen usable by plant . here bacterium change nitrogen into ammonium . nitrification be the process by which ammonium get change into nitrate by bacterium . nitrate be what the plant can then absorb . assimilation be how plant get nitrogen . they absorb nitrate from the soil into they root . then the nitrogen get use in amino acid , nucleic acid , and chlorophyll . ammonification be part of the decaying process . when a plant or animal die , decomposer like fungus and bacterium turn the nitrogen back into ammonium so it can reenter the nitrogen cycle . denitrification be when extra nitrogen in the soil get put back out into the air . there be special bacterium that perform this task as well .
