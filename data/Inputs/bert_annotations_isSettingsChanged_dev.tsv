This the most basic level to start with.\n- Folder structure matters, since skins can have variants, .ini files can be grouped into config folders to identify them (e.g. 2 variant skins for a custom clock)\n- Multiple skins combine to make a skin suite. The combined package is known as a "Root" folder. Roots are what get placed in the "Skins" folder when installed.'			False
