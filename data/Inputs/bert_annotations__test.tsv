'Is headphone powered on?'			'0 - Fixing the Cable'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'1 - Test the cable.\nTest the cable. To figure out where the break in the wires is, wear the headphones and turn on audio, then bend the cable to a right angle across the tip of your thumb. Slide your thumb along the length of the cable. When the sound crackles or cuts in and out, you have found the problem. If the problem is near the plug, see the next part for repair instructions. Otherwise, continue to the next step.[2]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Use a piece of tape or a Sharpie to mark the site of the break.\n- If you already found the problem with a multimeter, skip this step.'			True
'Is headphone powered on?'			"2 - Strip off the insulation.\nStrip off the insulation. Use wire strippers, or carefully run a knife around the outside of the cable, to remove ½ inch (1.25 cm) of the outer shielding, then extend the cut in either direction until you see a broken wire. This is the area you'll need to repair.;\n- If your cable looks like two cables glued together then each one will contain an insulated wire (the signal) and a bare wire (the ground).\n- Apple headphones and other headphones with single cables have two insulated wires (the left and right signal) and a single bare ground wire."			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'3 - Cut the cord.\nCut the cord. Cut the cord in half. If the wire inside is shredded, cut on either side of it to remove the problem. If you do this, remove the same amount from the left and right cords. Uneven lengths of cord can cause electrical damage to your headphones.[3]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- ;\n- If only one of your wires is broken, you might want to skip to soldering the wire, without cutting or splicing. This will save time, but the repair will be less sturdy.[4]\n- X\n- Research source'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			"4 - Slide on a shrink tube.\nSlide on a shrink tube. This is a rubber tubing that looks just like the rest of your headphone cable. Slide it onto the cable for later. After your repair, you'll slide this back over the open area to protect it.;\n- If you had to cut the wire several times to find the problem, slip on a tube over each cut."			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			"5 - Splice the wires\nSplice the wires. This means you'll be joining the wires together. Make sure to connect wires with the same color insulation (or no insulation). You have two options: a pigtail splice and an in-line splice.[5]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- ;\n- For a pigtail splice, pick up the two exposed areas of wire that you want to connect. Place them parallel to each other and twist them together to join them. This is quick and easy, but the repair will be bulkier.\n- For an in-line splice, overlap the wires end to end, then twist them in opposite directions. This is more difficult but the repair is easier to hide."			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'6 - Solder the connections.\nSolder the connections. Use a soldering iron to melt a small dab of solder over the wires. Repeat for each splice, then let the solder cool.;\n- Bare wires without insulation usually have a thin enamel coat. Sand this off or burn it off with the soldering iron before you solder. Avoid breathing in the fumes.[6]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Once cooled, keep the red and white ends separate from the ground wire by wrapping the 2 pairs of joins in electrical tape.'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'7 - Slide your shrink tube over the repair.\nSlide your shrink tube over the repair. After the shrink tube is properly fitted over the repair site, you can use a heat gun to constrict it.;\n- The tube will shrink down to about a quarter of its original size, which will allow it to fit  snugly around your newly-repaired cable, keeping it strong and protected.'			None
'Is airpod powered on?'			'0 - Cleaning Off Dirt and Dust'			None
'Is airpod powered on?'			'1 - Wipe down your AirPods with a microfiber cloth.\nWipe down your AirPods with a microfiber cloth. Don’t use a regular cloth or rag or you could damage the polish on your AirPods.[1]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n-  Microfiber cloths are also better at picking up small particles than regular cloths.[2]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n-  Hold the microfiber cloth in your hand and gently bring it over the entire surface of each AirPod.\n- ;'			True
'Is airpod powered on?'			'2 - Use a cotton swab to wipe off hard-to-reach areas.\nUse a cotton swab to wipe off hard-to-reach areas. Hold the cotton swab in your hand and gently rub the soft end through the small cracks and crevices on your AirPods. Carefully wipe over the speaker grills to remove any dust or wax that’s built up on them. Don’t push too hard on the speaker grills or you could damage them.[3]\n- X\n- Research source'			None
'Is airpod powered on?'			'3 - Rub away dirt and grime spots with a pencil eraser.\nRub away dirt and grime spots with a pencil eraser. Place the eraser on the spot you want to remove and gently rub the eraser back and forth. Once the spot is gone, wipe off any leftover eraser shavings with the microfiber cloth.[4]\n- X\n- Research source'			None
'Is airpod powered on?'			'4 - Brush the speaker grills with an anti-static brush.\nBrush the speaker grills with an anti-static brush. If you don’t have an anti-static brush, you can use the bristles on a clean, dry toothbrush instead. Use the bristles on the anti-static brush to brush away dust, dirt, or wax that’s stuck in the speaker grills. Use a gentle brushing motion so you don’t damage the grills.[5]\n- X\n- Research source'			None
'Is airpod powered on?'			'5 - Use a damp microfiber cloth as a last resort.\nUse a damp microfiber cloth as a last resort. If your AirPods haven’t been cleaned in a while, you may need to use a little bit of water to remove tough dirt and grime spots. Add a drop or two of distilled water onto a microfiber cloth so that it’s barely wet. Then, rub the damp part of the cloth over the surface of your AirPods. Don’t let the wet part of the cloth make contact with the speaker grills or moisture could get inside of them.[6]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- Use distilled water instead of tap water. Tap water has minerals that can damage the polish on your AirPods.'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'0 - Untangling the Cords'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'1 - Unplug your headphones from your device.\nUnplug your headphones from your device. This will make the untangling process much easier as you can freely move the cord. Be sure to take your headphones off your head. Locate the ends that you put into your ears, often called the earbuds.[6]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- ;'			False
'Is headphone powered on?'			'2 - Spread the cord out on a flat surface.\nSpread the cord out on a flat surface. This way, you will be able to examine the cord and find out where it is tangled. Obtain a pen or pencil, as you may need this if the knots are so tight that you cannot untangle them with your hands alone.[7]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- ;'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'3 - Pull the loose end to loosen the closest knot.\nPull the loose end to loosen the closest knot. Pull the knot apart with your fingers, in order to loosen the cord and allow for easier untangling. If you cannot use your hands, use the tip of a pen or pencil to separate the cords that are knotted.;\n- Work from the bottom up, since it is easier to untangle knots using a loose end.'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'4 - Pull the loose end of the cord through the tangled area.\nPull the loose end of the cord through the tangled area. This area should now look like hoop, which you can bring the rest of the cord through using your hands. Run the loose end of the cord underneath the knot.[8]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- ;'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'5 - Repeat these steps until each of the knots is untangled.\nRepeat these steps until each of the knots is untangled. You may have to loop the loose end of the cord through several different knots times before the entire cord becomes untangled. Be as patient with yourself as possible, since rushing the process can make the knots even worse.[9]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- ;'			None

Depending on your preferences, you can change certain settings. \n- Color: You could choose to have color or black and white.\n- DPI:  Increasing the DPI value to its highest is recommended for a better resolution (around 600 DPI will do fine) since it allows for manipulations later on. A lower value will be fine too, but editing it may make the drawing look worse.\n- File format: There are multiple file formats to choose but, JPEG and PNG are typically suitable. PNG is more preferable since it can scale while retaining its resolution at the cost of a larger file size.'			True
