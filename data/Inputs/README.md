#### Where are the files?
Checkout [`dataset/`](../../dataset/).

#### How can I train/evaluate the model?
All the files for the desired setup (from [`dataset/`](../../dataset/)) has to be placed here. This can be done manually or use the scripts provided in the root. For more info, see the [root REAMDE](../../README.md#helper-script-to-move-data-files).
