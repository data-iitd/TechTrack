'Is scan opened?'			'5 - Configure scan settings.\nConfigure scan settings.

A lower value will be fine too, but editing it may make the drawing look worse.\n- File format: There are multiple file formats to choose but, JPEG and PNG are typically suitable. PNG is more preferable since it can scale while retaining its resolution at the cost of a larger file size.'			None
