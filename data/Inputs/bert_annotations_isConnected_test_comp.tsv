'Is headphone connected?'			'0 - Fixing the Cable'			None
'Is headphone connected?'			'1 - Test the cable.\nTest the cable. To figure out where the break in the wires is, wear the headphones and turn on audio, then bend the cable to a right angle across the tip of your thumb. Slide your thumb along the length of the cable. When the sound crackles or cuts in and out, you have found the problem. If the problem is near the plug, see the next part for repair instructions. Otherwise, continue to the next step.[2]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Use a piece of tape or a Sharpie to mark the site of the break.\n- If you already found the problem with a multimeter, skip this step.'			None
'Is headphone connected?'			"2 - Strip off the insulation.\nStrip off the insulation. Use wire strippers, or carefully run a knife around the outside of the cable, to remove ½ inch (1.25 cm) of the outer shielding, then extend the cut in either direction until you see a broken wire. This is the area you'll need to repair.;\n- If your cable looks like two cables glued together then each one will contain an insulated wire (the signal) and a bare wire (the ground).\n- Apple headphones and other headphones with single cables have two insulated wires (the left and right signal) and a single bare ground wire."			None
'Is headphone connected?'			'3 - Cut the cord.\nCut the cord. Cut the cord in half. If the wire inside is shredded, cut on either side of it to remove the problem. If you do this, remove the same amount from the left and right cords. Uneven lengths of cord can cause electrical damage to your headphones.[3]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- ;\n- If only one of your wires is broken, you might want to skip to soldering the wire, without cutting or splicing. This will save time, but the repair will be less sturdy.[4]\n- X\n- Research source'			None
'Is headphone connected?'			"4 - Slide on a shrink tube.\nSlide on a shrink tube. This is a rubber tubing that looks just like the rest of your headphone cable. Slide it onto the cable for later. After your repair, you'll slide this back over the open area to protect it.;\n- If you had to cut the wire several times to find the problem, slip on a tube over each cut."			None
'Is headphone connected?'			"5 - Splice the wires\nSplice the wires. This means you'll be joining the wires together. Make sure to connect wires with the same color insulation (or no insulation). You have two options: a pigtail splice and an in-line splice.[5]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- ;\n- For a pigtail splice, pick up the two exposed areas of wire that you want to connect. Place them parallel to each other and twist them together to join them. This is quick and easy, but the repair will be bulkier.\n- For an in-line splice, overlap the wires end to end, then twist them in opposite directions. This is more difficult but the repair is easier to hide."			None
'Is headphone connected?'			'6 - Solder the connections.\nSolder the connections. Use a soldering iron to melt a small dab of solder over the wires. Repeat for each splice, then let the solder cool.;\n- Bare wires without insulation usually have a thin enamel coat. Sand this off or burn it off with the soldering iron before you solder. Avoid breathing in the fumes.[6]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Once cooled, keep the red and white ends separate from the ground wire by wrapping the 2 pairs of joins in electrical tape.'			None
'Is headphone connected?'			'7 - Slide your shrink tube over the repair.\nSlide your shrink tube over the repair. After the shrink tube is properly fitted over the repair site, you can use a heat gun to constrict it.;\n- The tube will shrink down to about a quarter of its original size, which will allow it to fit  snugly around your newly-repaired cable, keeping it strong and protected.'

'Is airpod connected?'			'1 - Wipe down your AirPods with a microfiber cloth.\nWipe down your AirPods with a microfiber cloth. Don’t use a regular cloth or rag or you could damage the polish on your AirPods.[1]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n-  Microfiber cloths are also better at picking up small particles than regular cloths.[2]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n-  Hold the microfiber cloth in your hand and gently bring it over the entire surface of each AirPod.\n- ;'			None
'Is airpod connected?'			'2 - Use a cotton swab to wipe off hard-to-reach areas.\nUse a cotton swab to wipe off hard-to-reach areas. Hold the cotton swab in your hand and gently rub the soft end through the small cracks and crevices on your AirPods. Carefully wipe over the speaker grills to remove any dust or wax that’s built up on them. Don’t push too hard on the speaker grills or you could damage them.[3]\n- X\n- Research source'			None
'Is airpod connected?'			'3 - Rub away dirt and grime spots with a pencil eraser.\nRub away dirt and grime spots with a pencil eraser. Place the eraser on the spot you want to remove and gently rub the eraser back and forth.

'Is airpod connected?'			'4 - Brush the speaker grills with an anti-static brush.\nBrush the speaker grills with an anti-static brush. If you don’t have an anti-static brush, you can use the bristles on a clean, dry toothbrush instead. Use the bristles on the anti-static brush to brush away dust, dirt, or wax that’s stuck in the speaker grills. Use a gentle brushing motion so you don’t damage the grills.[5]\n- X\n- Research source'			None
'Is airpod connected?'			'5 - Use a damp microfiber cloth as a last resort.\nUse a damp microfiber cloth as a last resort. If your AirPods haven’t been cleaned in a while, you may need to use a little bit of water to remove tough dirt and grime spots. Add a drop or two of distilled water onto a microfiber cloth so that it’s barely wet. Then, rub the damp part of the cloth over the surface of your AirPods. Don’t let the wet part of the cloth make contact with the speaker grills or moisture could get inside of them.[6]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- Use distilled water instead of tap water. Tap water has minerals that can damage the polish on your AirPods.'			None

'Is headphone connected?'			'2 - Spread the cord out on a flat surface.\nSpread the cord out on a flat surface. This way, you will be able to examine the cord and find out where it is tangled.

'Is headphone connected?'			'3 - Pull the loose end to loosen the closest knot.\nPull the loose end to loosen the closest knot. Pull the knot apart with your fingers, in order to loosen the cord and allow for easier untangling. If you cannot use your hands, use the tip of a pen or pencil to separate the cords that are knotted.;\n- Work from the bottom up, since it is easier to untangle knots using a loose end.'			None
'Is headphone connected?'			'4 - Pull the loose end of the cord through the tangled area.\nPull the loose end of the cord through the tangled area. This area should now look like hoop, which you can bring the rest of the cord through using your hands. Run the loose end of the cord underneath the knot.[8]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- ;'			None
'Is headphone connected?'			'5 - Repeat these steps until each of the knots is untangled.\nRepeat these steps until each of the knots is untangled. You may have to loop the loose end of the cord through several different knots times before the entire cord becomes untangled.
