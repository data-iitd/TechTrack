If your monitor won't display an image, turn it on and watch the lights at the edge of the monitor. If one or more lights turn on, continue to the next step. If the lights won't light up, the power supply is broken (or one of the attachments leading to the power supply). This is usually caused by a blown capacitor. You may repair it yourself, but be aware that the power supply includes dangerous, high voltage components. Unless you have significant electronics repair experience, take your monitor to a professional repair service.\n- Other signs of a blown capacitor include a loud humming noise, lines across the screen, and multiple images.\n- The power supply unit is one of the most expensive components in the monitor.

Rubbing too hard can cause further damage.[1]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Search for stuck pixel repair software online.

If you feel any broken glass, do not attempt repair. Replace the monitor instead.\n- Rub the scratch with a clean eraser, as gently as you can. Wipe off the eraser whenever residue builds up.\n- Purchase an LCD scratch repair kit.\n- Read this article for more homemade solutions."			False

This may be more cost-effective than having new components installed in an old monitor with a shorter lifespan. However, if you have a laptop or a relatively new device, purchase a replacement LCD display panel. Hire a professional to install it.\n- The panel serial number should be displayed somewhere on the device, usually on the back. Use this to order a new panel from the manufacturer.\n- While you can attempt to replace the panel yourself, the process is difficult and can expose you to dangerously high voltages.
