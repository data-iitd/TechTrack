This is much easier to work with.\n- When working with scans that were assigned time or date scan numbers, one option, although tedious, is to change those numbers to sequential numbers.  A better option, when working with time or date scan numbers, is to divide your scanned pages into small batches. The pages tend to stay in sequence when working with small batches.\n- When using Paper Port, divide your work in batches. Paper Port works much faster when working with a small amount of pages versus a large amount.

'Is photo editing program installed?'			'11 - Scan the book completely including the blank pages.\nScan the book completely including the blank pages. The blank pages have a purpose — they stop the flow of thought. If you do not include blank pages, include a note of this. For example, if blank pages 95 and 96 were omitted, put a note on page 94 (write: "page 95 and 96 were blank"), because in the future it might be temporarily confusing to find those two pages missing. Have the scan number correspond with the page number, or very close to it, so when using Adobe Reader later, it will be easy to navigate through the book.'			None
'Is photo editing program installed?'			'12 - Protect your home scanner by feeding it just one page at a time.\nProtect your home scanner by feeding it just one page at a time. Paper jams from feeding more than a page will wear out the scanner roller area faster.\n- Pages that were joined (stacked) by Paper Port can be separated into individual pages by Paper Port, but if you have have a batch of pages, all on one page, and made by your scanner -this file cannot be altered. If you scan your pages separately, any mistake can be deleted and replaced with a rescan of that page.'			None
'Is photo editing program installed?'			"13 - Take note of how your scanner assigns scan numbers.\nTake note of how your scanner assigns scan numbers. If your scanner assigns each scan a counter number, then do nothing. This is ideal for inserting a missing page or a page that had to be rescanned.\n- If your scanner automatically has the date and time for a scan number, configure your job to be on a counter. This is much easier to work with.\n- When working with scans that were assigned time or date scan numbers, one option, although tedious, is to change those numbers to sequential numbers.  A better option, when working with time or date scan numbers, is to divide your scanned pages into small batches. The pages tend to stay in sequence when working with small batches.\n- When using Paper Port, divide your work in batches. Paper Port works much faster when working with a small amount of pages versus a large amount. Instead of stacking 350 pages in one step, do it in several steps, of 60 pages per batch, and it will be much faster and less of a burden on your computer's memory."			None
'Is photo editing program installed?'			'14 - Use color scans for the front and back covers, as well as for pages with color photos.\nUse color scans for the front and back covers, as well as for pages with color photos. Do a few color scans with different DPI settings and check the size of each page when scanning a book totally in color. Multiply the scanned page size with the number of pages to calculate the total size of whole file.\n- Choose the DPI, carefully considering the readability and size of the scan. Color scans use a lot of space. Check the time is takes to scan a page at a high DPI — it will be in the minutes, while a black and white scan, at the default DPI, will be in seconds.\n- Know also that each color scan must be edited, with a photo editing program such as Windows Live Photo Gallery, because the text in your scans will be faded. In Windows Live go to "adjust exposure" then to "highlights" and finally move the slider knob in highlights to darken the text.'			None
'Is photo editing program installed?'			'15 - Use grayscale for black and white pictures.\nUse grayscale for black and white pictures. For each grayscale and color scan with picture (or photos) and text, edit the exposure so the text will be readable. Editing, here, is an absolute necessity as grayscale scans will be pale.\n- In Windows Live Photo Gallery, go to "adjust exposure" and adjust the "highlights" slider bar. Adjust the highlights to make the text darker and the text will be indistinguishable from a black and white scan. Adjusting the highlights will not affect your image or photo.'			None
'Is photo editing program installed?'			'16 - Use black and white for scanning text.\nUse black and white for scanning text. Set the scanner on black and white, do not set it on auto.  By setting the scanner on auto, the scanner will choose between color, grayscale and black and white, but the scanner does not make these choices as accurately as you can.'			None
'Is photo editing program installed?'			'17 - Review your scanned images.\nReview your scanned images. Always save the scanned images as TIFF files because TIFF files are easy to navigate and edit. Although your ultimate file type will be PDF (Paper Port can only join PDF files), PDF files in separate pages are difficult to navigate through.\n- For example, if you are reviewing 100 pages of TIFF files, you could scroll through them, but with PDF files you have to open (and close) each file one at a time. Furthermore, PDF files cannot be edited, so if you have a PDF file of 100 pages all connected from the beginning, and there are several pages that are unsatisfactory, you cannot do anything about it. For this reason, save your scans initially in TIFF or some other format that can be edited, and change to PDF later.'			None

'Is photo editing program installed?'			'19 - Have a good backup system on your hard drive or on an external drive.\nHave a good backup system on your hard drive or on an external drive. This is a precaution against computer failure, mistakes and accidental deletion. If your backup system fails, restore your deleted items from the recycle bin. Scanning can get confusing and mistakes happen. Ideally, do your scanning when your mind is rested and clear, but as this might not always be the case, use a backup system, at the very least.'			None
'Is photo editing program installed?'			'20 - Try not change the layout of the pages, especially the margins.\nTry not change the layout of the pages, especially the margins. A book that has small fonts is a good candidate for scanning, but do not crop your scans and reduce the margins (for example, because you want to make the book more readable) because margins serve a purpose. Margins are like a frame on a picture, and a page looks better with margins.\n- When reading that book, with the small fonts, later on your computer, you can easily make the fonts bigger by using the "zoom" feature. When working with books with very small print, you could crop each page a bit to make the final product a few percentage points larger and more readable.'			None
