'Is headphone powered on?'			'0 - Fixing the Cable'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'1 - Test the cable.\nTest the cable. To figure out where the break in the wires is, wear the headphones and turn on audio, then bend the cable to a right angle across the tip of your thumb. Slide your thumb along the length of the cable. When the sound crackles or cuts in and out, you have found the problem. If the problem is near the plug, see the next part for repair instructions. Otherwise, continue to the next step.[2]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Use a piece of tape or a Sharpie to mark the site of the break.\n- If you already found the problem with a multimeter, skip this step.'			True
'Is headphone powered on?'			"2 - Strip off the insulation.\nStrip off the insulation. Use wire strippers, or carefully run a knife around the outside of the cable, to remove ½ inch (1.25 cm) of the outer shielding, then extend the cut in either direction until you see a broken wire. This is the area you'll need to repair.;\n- If your cable looks like two cables glued together then each one will contain an insulated wire (the signal) and a bare wire (the ground).\n- Apple headphones and other headphones with single cables have two insulated wires (the left and right signal) and a single bare ground wire."			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'3 - Cut the cord.\nCut the cord. Cut the cord in half. If the wire inside is shredded, cut on either side of it to remove the problem. If you do this, remove the same amount from the left and right cords. Uneven lengths of cord can cause electrical damage to your headphones.[3]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- ;\n- If only one of your wires is broken, you might want to skip to soldering the wire, without cutting or splicing. This will save time, but the repair will be less sturdy.[4]\n- X\n- Research source'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			"4 - Slide on a shrink tube.\nSlide on a shrink tube. This is a rubber tubing that looks just like the rest of your headphone cable. Slide it onto the cable for later. After your repair, you'll slide this back over the open area to protect it.;\n- If you had to cut the wire several times to find the problem, slip on a tube over each cut."			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			"5 - Splice the wires\nSplice the wires. This means you'll be joining the wires together. Make sure to connect wires with the same color insulation (or no insulation). You have two options: a pigtail splice and an in-line splice.[5]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- ;\n- For a pigtail splice, pick up the two exposed areas of wire that you want to connect. Place them parallel to each other and twist them together to join them. This is quick and easy, but the repair will be bulkier.\n- For an in-line splice, overlap the wires end to end, then twist them in opposite directions. This is more difficult but the repair is easier to hide."			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'6 - Solder the connections.\nSolder the connections. Use a soldering iron to melt a small dab of solder over the wires. Repeat for each splice, then let the solder cool.;\n- Bare wires without insulation usually have a thin enamel coat. Sand this off or burn it off with the soldering iron before you solder. Avoid breathing in the fumes.[6]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Once cooled, keep the red and white ends separate from the ground wire by wrapping the 2 pairs of joins in electrical tape.'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'7 - Slide your shrink tube over the repair.\nSlide your shrink tube over the repair. After the shrink tube is properly fitted over the repair site, you can use a heat gun to constrict it.;\n- The tube will shrink down to about a quarter of its original size, which will allow it to fit  snugly around your newly-repaired cable, keeping it strong and protected.'

'Is bud powered on?'			'0 - Troubleshooting the Fit of Your Earbuds'			None
'Is bud powered on?'			'1 - Hang the cord over your ears.\nHang the cord over your ears. Instead of inserting your earbuds so the cord hangs straight down from your ear canal, insert them "upside down" and loop the cord over the back of your ear.\n- This may feel strange at first if you\'re not used to it, but it will prevent the buds from slipping out every time the cord is slightly jerked or pulled.[1]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- ;'			None
'Is bud powered on?'			"2 - Insert the buds firmly into your ears.\nInsert the buds firmly into your ears. Earbuds are meant to fit snugly into your ear canal. If your earbuds don't seem to sit comfortably in your ears, you may simply need to insert them more carefully.\n- Stretch your earlobe gently with one hand to open the ear canal while inserting each earbud, then release so that your ear cavity shapes itself around the earbud and forms a tight seal.[2]\n- X\n- Research source"			True
'Is bud powered on?'			"3 - Use the attachments that come with your earbuds.\nUse the attachments that come with your earbuds. Don't disregard those extra foam or silicone tips that come packaged with your earbuds. Experiment with different sizes to see which is most comfortable for you. It's even possible that one of your ears is slightly larger than the other, and you may want to use two different sizes.[3]\n- X\n- Research source"			None
'Is bud powered on?'			'4 - Purchase special attachments.\nPurchase special attachments. You can purchase accessories for your existing earbuds to customize the fit. These are great for improving the fit of those cheap round earbuds that came free with your device. A popular choice is Yurbuds, soft rubber attachments that create a more snug fit into the ear. They can even be made in custom sizes.[4]\n- X\n- Research source'			None
'Is bud powered on?'			"5 - Don't clean your ears with cotton swabs.\nDon't clean your ears with cotton swabs. A buildup of earwax can cause your earbuds to fit poorly and fall out. Using cotton swabs to remove earwax can actually cause the wax to be pushed against your eardrum, causing a blockage and possibly resulting in discomfort while wearing earbuds. Don't use Q-tips, and see a doctor if you think you may have an earwax blockage.[5]\n- X\n- Research source"			None

The more hours you can get without having to loop the playlist, the better. You want lots of different music so it loosens the drivers in your headphones and they become accustomed to producing various sounds at an optimal level.[1]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Even if you don’t like a particular genre of music, you should include it in your playlist to give your headphones the best workout.\n- Add a mixture of pop, rock, heavy metal, rap, hip-hop and R&B, country, and classical music to ensure a wide range.\n- ;'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'2 - Incorporate periods of white noise and pink noise on your playlist.\nIncorporate periods of white noise and pink noise on your playlist. You can use your audio software to loop pink and/or white noise so that it plays for an extended period of time. An easier method would be to find a video that plays pink or white noise on YouTube and play it through your headphones.[2]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- For good measure, search “frequency sweeps” on YouTube to include 20-20000 Hz, 10-30000 Hz, and 20-200 Hz frequency sweeps on your playlist.'			None
'Is headphone powered on?'			'3 - Use a program on your computer to make a playlist of the burn-in tracks.\nUse a program on your computer to make a playlist of the burn-in tracks. Alternate the music genres to encourage your headphones to adjust to the various changes in bass, treble, and frequency. Programs like Windows Media Player, iTunes, and Winamp are easy to use for making custom playlists.\n- Add the songs you want, then organize the files by alternating the genres. For instance, play a country song followed by a heavy metal track.[3]\n- X\n- Research source'			True
'Is headphone powered on?'			'4 - Get a pre-recorded audio file if you don’t have time to make a playlist.\nGet a pre-recorded audio file if you don’t have time to make a playlist.
