Most of these machines only have marginal user accounts because they are rarely accessed(by regular users). You need to look at many directories (each having many files) and do not want to keep typing "ls -alth | more" (This command is a directory listing command that lists all files, in order of most recent modification and lists the size of the file in human readable form. It will halt scrolling when the page is filled until you press the space key.)You type: alias l \\\'ls -alth | more\\\'Now, you only have to type "l" to issue the command.\\n- Permanent aliases\\n- Check to see if an .aliases file already exists in your home directory.\\n- If the .aliases file already exists, make a copy of it before you begin.\\n- Create or Modify the .aliases file using emacs or vi. Use the same syntax as when you made a temporary alias: alias <name of your alias> \\\'<command you wish to substitute>\\\'\\n- Here is an example from an .aliases file:alias l \\\'ll -alht | more\\\'alias clock \\\'xclock -fg red -hd green -bg black &\\\'alias giant \\\'xterm -bg black -fg cyan -fn courr24 -sb -sl 500 -n `hostname` & \\\'alias tiny \\\'xterm -bg black -fg cyan -sb -sl 500 -fn courr08 -n `hostname` &\\\'\\n- If you wish to use your permanent aliases without logging back in do this:source .aliasesYour aliases will be available in that window ONLY (unless you repeat the command in the other windows) during the current session. Any new windows that read the file will have the aliases automatically available.\''			True

Always save the scanned images as TIFF files because TIFF files are easy to navigate and edit. Although your ultimate file type will be PDF (Paper Port can only join PDF files), PDF files in separate pages are difficult to navigate through.\\n- For example, if you are reviewing 100 pages of TIFF files, you could scroll through them, but with PDF files you have to open (and close) each file one at a time. Furthermore, PDF files cannot be edited, so if you have a PDF file of 100 pages all connected from the beginning, and there are several pages that are unsatisfactory, you cannot do anything about it. For this reason, save your scans initially in TIFF or some other format that can be edited, and change to PDF later. 18 - After reviewing your scanned images in the TIFF format, save your images in PDF form.\\nAfter reviewing your scanned images in the TIFF format, save your images in PDF form. Next, using Paper Port, join (stack) the pages into one big file. Stacked files can be unstacked, in case you find an error later. A stacked PDF file will be easy to navigate through.\''			True

For each grayscale and color scan with picture (or photos) and text, edit the exposure so the text will be readable. Editing, here, is an absolute necessity as grayscale scans will be pale.\\n- In Windows Live Photo Gallery, go to "adjust exposure" and adjust the "highlights" slider bar. Adjust the highlights to make the text darker and the text will be indistinguishable from a black and white scan. Adjusting the highlights will not affect your image or photo. 16 - Use black and white for scanning text.\\nUse black and white for scanning text.

A book that has small fonts is a good candidate for scanning, but do not crop your scans and reduce the margins (for example, because you want to make the book more readable) because margins serve a purpose. Margins are like a frame on a picture, and a page looks better with margins.\\n- When reading that book, with the small fonts, later on your computer, you can easily make the fonts bigger by using the "zoom" feature. When working with books with very small print, you could crop each page a bit to make the final product a few percentage points larger and more readable.\''			True

Paper Port connects the scanned pages together and it also converts your scans to various file types such as PDF, TIFF, JPEG, BNG, etc. PDF files are good because they cannot accidentally be altered later when reading your book on your computer. For basic scanning, PDF and TIFF files are enough. 10 - Also consider download Windows Live image editing program or similar software.\\nAlso consider download Windows Live image editing program or similar software. Use Windows Live to fix the irregular edges of the pages by cropping them. These irregular edges are caused when separating the book into individual pages and could be distracting to view. Use the "straighten image" and "cropping" features in Windows Live.\\n- If you so desire, make your scanning projects technically correct. Windows Live works well because the final product will be uniform in size without configuring. 11 - Scan the book completely including the blank pages.\\nScan the book completely including the blank pages. The blank pages have a purpose — they stop the flow of thought. If you do not include blank pages, include a note of this. For example, if blank pages 95 and 96 were omitted, put a note on page 94 (write: "page 95 and 96 were blank"), because in the future it might be temporarily confusing to find those two pages missing. Have the scan number correspond with the page number, or very close to it, so when using Adobe Reader later, it will be easy to navigate through the book. 12 - Protect your home scanner by feeding it just one page at a time.\\nProtect your home scanner by feeding it just one page at a time. Paper jams from feeding more than a page will wear out the scanner roller area faster.\\n- Pages that were joined (stacked) by Paper Port can be separated into individual pages by Paper Port, but if you have have a batch of pages, all on one page, and made by your scanner -this file cannot be altered.

'Is photo editing program installed?'			\\n- Know also that each color scan must be edited, with a photo editing program such as Windows Live Photo Gallery, because the text in your scans will be faded. In Windows Live go to "adjust exposure" then to "highlights" and finally move the slider knob in highlights to darken the text. 15 - Use grayscale for black and white pictures.\\nUse grayscale for black and white pictures. For each grayscale and color scan with picture (or photos) and text, edit the exposure so the text will be readable. Editing, here, is an absolute necessity as grayscale scans will be pale.\\n- In Windows Live Photo Gallery, go to "adjust exposure" and adjust the "highlights" slider bar. Adjust the highlights to make the text darker and the text will be indistinguishable from a black and white scan. Adjusting the highlights will not affect your image or photo. 16 - Use black and white for scanning text.\\nUse black and white for scanning text. Set the scanner on black and white, do not set it on auto. By setting the scanner on auto, the scanner will choose between color, grayscale and black and white, but the scanner does not make these choices as accurately as you can. 17 - Review your scanned images.\\nReview your scanned images. Always save the scanned images as TIFF files because TIFF files are easy to navigate and edit. Although your ultimate file type will be PDF (Paper Port can only join PDF files), PDF files in separate pages are difficult to navigate through.\\n- For example, if you are reviewing 100 pages of TIFF files, you could scroll through them, but with PDF files you have to open (and close) each file one at a time.

This is a precaution against computer failure, mistakes and accidental deletion. If your backup system fails, restore your deleted items from the recycle bin. Scanning can get confusing and mistakes happen. Ideally, do your scanning when your mind is rested and clear, but as this might not always be the case, use a backup system, at the very least.\''			True

A book that has small fonts is a good candidate for scanning, but do not crop your scans and reduce the margins (for example, because you want to make the book more readable) because margins serve a purpose. Margins are like a frame on a picture, and a page looks better with margins.\\n- When reading that book, with the small fonts, later on your computer, you can easily make the fonts bigger by using the "zoom" feature. When working with books with very small print, you could crop each page a bit to make the final product a few percentage points larger and more readable.\''			True
