'5 - Create Aliases -- Aliases in Unix are commands that substitute for other commands.\nCreate Aliases -- Aliases in Unix are commands that substitute for other commands.\n- For instance, you are constantly typing "Ls" instead of "ls" when you are trying to list a directory.  So you create an alias that makes "Ls" behave like "ls".\n- Unix administrators often arrange that all users have the command rm set up as an alias for "rm -i".  This forces the user to type "y" before deleting a file!\n- Make sure that the alias you wish to set up is not already in use.  Use the command "which" to verify that the command is not in use.  If you see this, it is ok to proceed: which jk jk: Command not found.\n- Temporary Aliases  -- if you need an alias for only a short time, create it at the command prompt.  type: alias <name of the alias> \'<command you wish to substitute>\'\n- Example, you are working in a facility with 3,000 CPUs.  Most of these machines only have marginal user accounts because they are rarely accessed(by regular users).  You need to look at many directories (each having many files) and do not want to keep typing "ls -alth | more" (This command is a directory listing command that lists all files, in order of most recent modification and lists the size of the file in human readable form.  It will halt scrolling when the page is filled until you press the space key.)You type: alias l \'ls -alth | more\'Now, you only have to type "l" to issue the command.\n- Permanent aliases\n- Check to see if an .aliases file already exists in your home directory.\n- If the .aliases file already exists, make a copy of it before you begin.\n- Create or Modify the .aliases file using emacs or vi.  Use the same syntax as when you made a temporary alias: alias <name of your alias> \'<command you wish to substitute>\'\n- Here is an example from an .aliases file:alias l         \'ll -alht | more\'alias clock     \'xclock -fg red -hd green -bg black &\'alias giant     \'xterm -bg black -fg cyan -fn courr24 -sb -sl 500 -n `hostname` & \'alias tiny      \'xterm -bg black -fg cyan -sb -sl 500 -fn courr08 -n `hostname` &\'\n- If you wish to use your permanent aliases without logging back in do this:source .aliasesYour aliases will be available in that window ONLY (unless you repeat the command in the other windows) during the current session.

'Were settings of window live changed?'			"1 - Choose a scanner.\nChoose a scanner. You'll need to make a choice between a flatbed scanner and a sheet feed scanner, depending on what you can afford and what you're looking for:\n- A flatbed scanner generally costs less and offers precise scans. The benefits of this scanner is that the book does not require its pages separated or its binding to be destroyed. Furthermore, flatbeds can easily scan just about anything that can be placed on the glass, not just paper documents. It is simple and flexible, especially for books.\n- A sheet feed scanner is able to scan both sides of the page and is much faster than a flatbed. A sheet feed scanner requires the same amount of space as a flatbed, but scanning a bound book is impossible using this type of scanner (unless the book is destroyed by separating each of the pages.) There are some other disadvantages to sheet feed scanners:\n- The moving parts required to do the job of feeding are prone to jamming and malfunction, which typically renders the scanner useless.\n- Feed scanners are not designed for books, but for digitizing large amounts of single-page documents.\n- Feed scanners usually offer less crisp images; the pages have to move through the scanner in order to be read by the machine.\n- \n- ;"			False

A good sheet feed scanner, even at the low end in price, is an investment, so consider getting an extended warranty from a third party. If you\'ll be using your scanner a lot, get an extended warranty.\n- The well known third party warranty users like "Square Trade" cost more than other warranty issuers. But because such companies tend to be affiliated with well known companies, you can generally have more confidence in them.\n- The warranty price and length will be cheaper than getting an extended warranty bought locally. Weigh the expense by factoring in the costs of shipping (if necessary), insurance, confidence in the warranty issuer, and your estimate of the frequency of repair.'			False
'Were settings of window live changed?'			'3 - Separate the book into individual pages.\nSeparate the book into individual pages. This is an absolute necessity with a sheet feed scanner. With a flatbed scanner, it is a good idea to separate the pages to achieve an excellent scan and to avoid damaging your scanner because scanning a bound book requires pressing the cover on the book with some force.\n- If there is a print or copy shop nearby, you may be able to take the book to them and ask them to cut off the binding with large powerful paper shears. This costs very little and will save a great deal of time; it eliminates the next few steps and all your pages will be square and devoid of binding glue or stitching.'			False
'Were settings of window live changed?'			'4 - Remove the binding from the book.\nRemove the binding from the book. Contrary to what you may think, there are easy ways to do this with both a hardcover book and a paperback:\n- Hardcover: Use a utility knife to cut the paper hinge between the covers and endpapers. Then hit the flue with a moist, not wet, sponge to remove any paper residue.\n- Paperback: Use a blow-drier on its warm, not hot, setting to slowly heat up the glue holding the paper to the spine. Then simply pull the pages from the spine until they all come off in one bunch.'			False

'Were settings of window live photo gallery changed?'			'17 - Review your scanned images.\nReview your scanned images. Always save the scanned images as TIFF files because TIFF files are easy to navigate and edit. Although your ultimate file type will be PDF (Paper Port can only join PDF files), PDF files in separate pages are difficult to navigate through.\n- For example, if you are reviewing 100 pages of TIFF files, you could scroll through them, but with PDF files you have to open (and close) each file one at a time. Furthermore, PDF files cannot be edited, so if you have a PDF file of 100 pages all connected from the beginning, and there are several pages that are unsatisfactory, you cannot do anything about it. For this reason, save your scans initially in TIFF or some other format that can be edited, and change to PDF later.'			False

This is a precaution against computer failure, mistakes and accidental deletion. If your backup system fails, restore your deleted items from the recycle bin. Scanning can get confusing and mistakes happen. Ideally, do your scanning when your mind is rested and clear, but as this might not always be the case, use a backup system, at the very least.'

'Were settings of window live photo gallery changed?'			'20 - Try not change the layout of the pages, especially the margins.\nTry not change the layout of the pages, especially the margins. A book that has small fonts is a good candidate for scanning, but do not crop your scans and reduce the margins (for example, because you want to make the book more readable) because margins serve a purpose. Margins are like a frame on a picture, and a page looks better with margins.\n- When reading that book, with the small fonts, later on your computer, you can easily make the fonts bigger by using the "zoom" feature. When working with books with very small print, you could crop each page a bit to make the final product a few percentage points larger and more readable.'			False
