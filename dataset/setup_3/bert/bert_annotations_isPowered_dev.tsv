If you feel any broken glass, do not attempt repair. Replace the monitor instead.\\n- Rub the scratch with a clean eraser, as gently as you can. Wipe off the eraser whenever residue builds up.\\n- Purchase an LCD scratch repair kit.\\n- Read this article for more homemade solutions. 6 - Replace the display.\\nReplace the display. If you\\\'re using a standalone LCD monitor, consider purchasing a replacement. This may be more cost-effective than having new components installed in an old monitor with a shorter lifespan. However, if you have a laptop or a relatively new device, purchase a replacement LCD display panel. Hire a professional to install it.\\n- The panel serial number should be displayed somewhere on the device, usually on the back. Use this to order a new panel from the manufacturer.\\n- While you can attempt to replace the panel yourself, the process is difficult and can expose you to dangerously high voltages.

There are many ways an LCD monitor can go wrong, but the diagnostics above cover the most common problems. Try the suggested fix that matches your problem first. If your problem is not described above, or if the monitor still won\\'t work after the attempted fix, consider these issues as well:\\n- If the picture responds to input but displays a messy image, such as jumbled multicolored squares, the AV (audio visual) board may be damaged. This is usually a rectangular circuit board located near the audio and visual cables. Replace obviously damaged parts using a soldering iron, or order a replacement board and carefully install it to the same screws and ribbon cables.\\n- The main control buttons may be faulty. Clean them with a metal cleaner, or jostle to attach a loose connection. If necessary, locate the circuit board they are attached to and re-solder any broken connections.\\n- Check input cables for damage, or try other cables of the same type. If necessary, inspect the circuit board they are attached to and re-solder damaged connections.'"			True
