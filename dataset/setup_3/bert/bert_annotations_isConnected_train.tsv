You\'ll need to remove all the working parts from the space between the number pad and the other keys so that the case can be cut without damaging the insides with less-than-ideally placed or stress-focusing ragged cuts to mechanical parts, or with breaks in electronic circuits. To do that, you have to open up the keyboard. Before you take apart something complicated or unintuitive, or once you notice that you have (seeing, for instance, an array of different-length screws), make a reminder of how to put it back together. Take notes or a digital picture.\\n- Turn the keyboard upside down and remove the screws from the back.\\n- Sometimes, a plastic case may be held together partly by one or more screws hidden under a sticker. If so, poke into and slice around the edges of a round depression or lump in it with a small knife, or just poke a screwdriver through. In an area that would show, gently lift up the edge of the sticker with a knife (a blunt one will often do) and peel it up, lifting more than rolling back so as not to crease it, impart a strong bend that won\'t go back down, or damage the surface. If you remove it entirely, set it sticky-side-up out of harm\'s way until time to replace it.\\n- Sometimes a plastic case may be held together by an interlocking tab at an edge. If so, lift out the other edge first or bend one or both mating parts to free it.\\n- Sometimes a case may be held together by screws extending from the top into the bottom, such as screws under the spacebar, which pops off, on a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000, or screws under stickers.\\n- When you have the bottom free, set the keyboard on a table to complete disassembly so its parts don\'t dump out before you see how they all fit together."'

It\'s best to put the risk of mistakes closest to the keys you don\'t want, and, depending on the keyboard\'s design, a plastic rib remaining on the number-pad side will help anchor the truncated key assembly securely in position with the truncated keyboard case.

In addition to creating a straight, square profile, take care to preserve the stiffening flanges and ribs near the number pad.[4]\\n- X\\n- Research source\\n- \\n- Wide masking tape is great for marking straight lines: place it on the side to be kept, with its far edge indicating the place to cut. It stays fairly straight when stretched taut (stretch any tape from the middle of its width, rather than along one edge, to reduce curving) to automatically continue a straight line and may reduce lifting of little bits of plastic, i.e., burring, at the cut edge.On the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, there is a squarish stiffening flange extending inward at the edge of the top cover\'s hole for the number pad. Keep this for strength. Tear off several inches of tape, set the edge of the tape along the edge of this flange (next to, but not into, which you\'ll cut), and continue the tape forward and back.If you\'ll use a long, stiff saw to cut the case, you\'ll just saw across the whole breadth at once and continue down through the bottom cover. If not, you may need to mark the bottom cover for cutting. You may not just be able to wrap the tape around, since a varying cross section from one end to the other might cause the tape not to continue straight around. Use a separate piece of tape lined up with the first at the front and back of the keyboard before the places its path curves. Or line up the bottom cover marking tape with measurements taken inward from the right edge of the case by a ruled carpenter\'s square hanging over that edge, matching measurements from given points at the margin of the top-cover tape to the edge of the case to corresponding points at the margin of the bottom-cover tape. (Because the bottom cover is smaller than the top cover, tucking into it, you can\'t just measure equal distances inward from the edge of each cover separately).\\n- If the keyboard case has stick-on or otherwise removable feet where you will cut, or on the part you will cut off, peel them off and set them aside to leave the adhesive untouched, and stick them at uncushioned corners after you reassemble the keyboard."'

It\'s just thin plastic, so pretty much anything will cut it. But shears would twist and break it. A sharp, coarse-bladed hacksaw or a backsaw will be best: lay the blade flat on a flat part of the line to be cut, press and drag it somewhat firmly to start the kerf (take care to start a single distinct cut without marring the surrounding material), and keep the blade vertical as you saw through the top and bottom covers. No need to press hard once the saw is started in its kerf: push back and forth gently, and let it do the work until the keyboard case just comes apart.If you have only a little saw, you can cut the frame from one end to the other (watch the number-pad left flange and cut next to it). If you have a hobby rotary tool such as a Dremel, you could follow the tape all the way around. Wear hand and eye protection, particularly if you are using a hacksaw (whose blade can break), a saw with big teeth, or a small power tool (a big one would be very dangerous). Protect the work surface with something like scrap wood or an old telephone book.\\n- Save the removed pieces. You might be able to use part of the removed bottom cover, especially if it was cut off perfectly straight, to close up the cut edge of the keyboard.\\n- You can use sandpaper to smooth very-rough areas. But it will create many fine, messy plastic particles. Don\'t turn a fairly straight, rough edge into a smooth, wavy edge through uneven sanding if you plan to attach a flat, rigid cover to the cut edge. A sanding block to hold the paper flat would help avoid this and the gaps it would leave.\\n- Unless you\'re going to glue a rigid plate over the entire cut end, you can gently round the cut corners by stroking a flat file around them a few times for appearance. Since the rounded profile will look good, but the cut edge won\'t, keep the file in a vertical plane. You could use sandpaper on a flat surface or in a sanding block instead of a file.\\n- Once you\'ve finished cutting and grinding, remove the tape and open the keyboard case again so you can clean out the shavings."'

This will be easiest if you support the front cover by edges or corners so the key assemblies can drop in fully rather than themselves resting on a table. Put in the electronic controller, lights, and keys; put in the dome switches; put in the membrane; and set up electrical connections (on a Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, don\'t forget the rubber pad that squeezes the membrane-controller connection together). Line up all of the the dome switches\' and membrane\'s retention holes. Screw on the back cover. Put on any rubber feet you removed and, after the keyboard is working and this project is otherwise finished, replace any stickers you removed. The number pad part of the keyboard membrane will just hang out of the keyboard case for now. Touching the protruding membrane may cause errors such as unwanted number-pad keystrokes."'			False
'Is keyboard connected?'			 11 - Vacuum up the plastic shavings.\\nVacuum up the plastic shavings. A clean soft bristle attachment would be best, and any small nozzle would be good, for breaking their static cling to surfaces and sweeping away burrs from cut edges. 12 - If the number pad dome switches are part of a larger sheet, cut them off.\\nIf the number pad dome switches are part of a larger sheet, cut them off. If the number pad keys are part of a larger assembly, the dome switches probably are part of a larger sheet. They\'re held in place under the keys by being squeezed at the edges, and their sheet is soft and probably translucently inconspicuous, so it\'s best to leave a fraction of an inch (cm) margin beyond what is needed than to leave too little. Be sure to only cut off the number key switches, not the navigation key switches, and trim close to the switches to be removed rather than close to the ones to keep.

Check that all of the remaining keys gently snap and rebound when tapped, as before. Plug in the keyboard and check that all of the keys work. You may need to restart the computer for it to recognize that the keyboard has been attached. If the keyboard doesn\'t work, check that it\'s plugged in to a working port, and, if that\'s not the problem, open the keyboard and inspect the assembly. If only some of the keys do not perform correctly, check the assembly near them in particular."'			False
'Is keyboard connected?'			 Pair up the cut edges at the right edge and the top or bottom edge of the plastic wrap (whichever isn\\'t wrapped) and press them together so they cling. Keep the plastic wrap only one layer thick and trim off any great excess extending past the membrane layer edge. A 1/2 inch (1 cm) margin is plenty.You could try plastic tape instead of plastic wrap. It would stay in place readily. But attempting to remove it, as you might want to try if something doesn\\'t work initially, could damage the circuit traces--possibly invisibly--and kill the keyboard.Turn the keyboard over and loosen the screws holding the number-pad side of it together, and if necessary the others, so that the cut edge of the keyboard can loosen by a small fraction of an inch (a few mm). Bend over the membrane flap, all layers together, and tuck it in under the navigation keys\\' adjacent membrane. You may have to tuck the membrane flap in at a slight angle to best accommodate the screws and other obstructions extending through the keyboard. Leave at least the very edge of the fold out so that it doesn\\'t get creased hard and possibly soon break on its own. You could roll up the flap, too, but it might be harder to store or cover if it is rolled up and under tension to expand than if it is simply bent over.\\n- Folding the membrane into many layers (which will bulge around the folded edges, inside and outside the keyboard enclosure) to tuck into a small space will likely make it too thick and press on the adjacent navigation key switches from underneath. So, you may be left with most of it tucked in and a little sticking out at the keyboard edge. Ignoring that works great.You could cover the cut edge of the keyboard with wide, strong tape such as mailing tape, a hard cover of another material, or even a flat piece of plastic made from the cut-off piece of the bottom cover, tipped upward. If you use tape, and have to remove the tape, carefully free it from the plastic wrap or you may pull that off and have to replace it. If you use part of the bottom cover, you may have to remove or trim down its rim and ribs, and mark its inside edge for cutting by reference to the contour of the edge of the top cover above the bottom cover. After cleaning the mating surfaces, you could attach the plate made from the bottom cover or other rigid material with glue, solvent cement, or strong double-sided tape suitable for the materials involved. If glued or cemented, they would probably have to be held firmly with a device such as a strap clamp until dry. Attaching an improvised cover with a strong adhesive or cement could frustrate opening the keyboard later.'"			False
