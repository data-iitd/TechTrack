Confirm your settings are at "Normal" or "Plain Paper" and set with 300 or 600 DPI resolution. Be sure you have plenty of ink. 3 - Test label placement.\nTest label placement. Print your labels onto a blank sheet of white paper before loading the labels into the printer. Place the sheet you printed on top of a sheet of labels and hold them up to some light. This will tell you if the label positions are correct. 4 - Make sure the label sheets are not stuck together.\nMake sure the label sheets are not stuck together. Fan them out if you are loading a stack of labels into the printer. Be careful not to bend the corners or peel off any labels while doing this. 5 - Determine if you need to load inkjet labels facing down or facing up.\nDetermine if you need to load inkjet labels facing down or facing up. This depends on how your inkjet printer is set up. To figure this out, print something on a piece of letterhead or other marked paper, and make a note of how you loaded the paper into the printer. 6 - Load the labels into the paper tray.\nLoad the labels into the paper tray. The number of label sheets you use will depend on how many labels you are preparing to print. Keep a stack of 25 pages of plain paper in the tray to better support the label sheets. 7 - Fit the paper width lever around the labels so that it is barely touching the sheets.\nFit the paper width lever around the labels so that it is barely touching the sheets. Do not fit it too tightly or the labels will buckle. If it is too loose, the labels may not print straight. 8 - Print your labels.\nPrint your labels. Allow the ink to dry completely on the labels before removing them, to avoid smudging.'			True

By working quickly, you’ll help minimize the risk of electrical damage.[11]\\n- X\\n- Research source\\n- \\n- \\n- If the laptop starts to smoke or steam, or you see bubbling or bulging, don\'t touch it. You could be seriously burned or suffer an electrical shock.[12]\\n- X\\n- Research source\\n- \\n- \\n- Even if you get the laptop dry, residue from sugary, acidic, or alcoholic drinks may still be present, and that residue may affect the functionality of your keyboard in the future. 2 - Turn the laptop upside down over a towel.\\nTurn the laptop upside down over a towel. Open the laptop as wide as you can, turn it face down, and set it on top of a towel or another absorbent material. By flipping the laptop over, you are allowing gravity to pull the moisture away from the motherboard and other electrical components.[13]\\n- X\\n- Research source 3 - Blot away as much of the liquid as you can right away.\\nBlot away as much of the liquid as you can right away. If you have a microfiber or lint-free cloth on hand, use that to dry the laptop. However, you’re racing against time, so if you don’t have one of those handy, just grab whatever is closest to you, whether that’s a dish towel, paper towels, or even an old T-shirt. Dry any liquid that you can see on the surface of the laptop.[14]\\n- X\\n- Research source 4 - Leave your laptop propped up to dry for 1-2 days.\\nLeave your laptop propped up to dry for 1-2 days. There’s no way to rush this process. Even if the laptop looks dry from the outside, moisture could be trapped inside. To be safe, give the keyboard a minimum of 24 hours to dry before you try to turn it on again.[15]\\n- X\\n- Research source 5 - Take your laptop for professional cleaning if the liquid was sugary.\\nTake your laptop for professional cleaning if the liquid was sugary. If you splashed a little water into the keyboard, you\'re probably fine, but if you spilled a large, sugary drink and it\'s an expensive laptop, consider having a professional break down your laptop and clean inside. Professional cleaning can run upward of $500, but it can be worth it if you have a lot of money invested in your laptop.[16]\\n- X\\n- Research source\\n- \\n- If you\'re familiar with electronics, you can take it apart yourself and clean inside, but some laptops can only be dismantled with special tools that you might not have on hand. 6 - Replace the battery and turn on the laptop once it\'s dried completely.\\nReplace the battery and turn on the laptop once it\'s dried completely. This will be the moment of truth. If your laptop doesn’t work at all, give it another 24 hours to dry out. If your operating system boots up but the keyboard doesn\'t work, you can replace the keyboard or use a USB keyboard.[17]\\n- X\\n- Research source"'			False

In addition to creating a straight, square profile, take care to preserve the stiffening flanges and ribs near the number pad.[4]\\n- X\\n- Research source\\n- \\n- Wide masking tape is great for marking straight lines: place it on the side to be kept, with its far edge indicating the place to cut. It stays fairly straight when stretched taut (stretch any tape from the middle of its width, rather than along one edge, to reduce curving) to automatically continue a straight line and may reduce lifting of little bits of plastic, i.e., burring, at the cut edge.On the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, there is a squarish stiffening flange extending inward at the edge of the top cover\'s hole for the number pad. Keep this for strength. Tear off several inches of tape, set the edge of the tape along the edge of this flange (next to, but not into, which you\'ll cut), and continue the tape forward and back.If you\'ll use a long, stiff saw to cut the case, you\'ll just saw across the whole breadth at once and continue down through the bottom cover. If not, you may need to mark the bottom cover for cutting. You may not just be able to wrap the tape around, since a varying cross section from one end to the other might cause the tape not to continue straight around. Use a separate piece of tape lined up with the first at the front and back of the keyboard before the places its path curves. Or line up the bottom cover marking tape with measurements taken inward from the right edge of the case by a ruled carpenter\'s square hanging over that edge, matching measurements from given points at the margin of the top-cover tape to the edge of the case to corresponding points at the margin of the bottom-cover tape.

It\'s just thin plastic, so pretty much anything will cut it. But shears would twist and break it. A sharp, coarse-bladed hacksaw or a backsaw will be best: lay the blade flat on a flat part of the line to be cut, press and drag it somewhat firmly to start the kerf (take care to start a single distinct cut without marring the surrounding material), and keep the blade vertical as you saw through the top and bottom covers. No need to press hard once the saw is started in its kerf: push back and forth gently, and let it do the work until the keyboard case just comes apart.If you have only a little saw, you can cut the frame from one end to the other (watch the number-pad left flange and cut next to it). If you have a hobby rotary tool such as a Dremel, you could follow the tape all the way around.

You might be able to use part of the removed bottom cover, especially if it was cut off perfectly straight, to close up the cut edge of the keyboard.\\n- You can use sandpaper to smooth very-rough areas.

Don\'t turn a fairly straight, rough edge into a smooth, wavy edge through uneven sanding if you plan to attach a flat, rigid cover to the cut edge.

'Is keyboard powered on?'			 Pair up the cut edges at the right edge and the top or bottom edge of the plastic wrap (whichever isn\\'t wrapped) and press them together so they cling. Keep the plastic wrap only one layer thick and trim off any great excess extending past the membrane layer edge. A 1/2 inch (1 cm) margin is plenty.You could try plastic tape instead of plastic wrap. It would stay in place readily. But attempting to remove it, as you might want to try if something doesn\\'t work initially, could damage the circuit traces--possibly invisibly--and kill the keyboard.Turn the keyboard over and loosen the screws holding the number-pad side of it together, and if necessary the others, so that the cut edge of the keyboard can loosen by a small fraction of an inch (a few mm). Bend over the membrane flap, all layers together, and tuck it in under the navigation keys\\' adjacent membrane. You may have to tuck the membrane flap in at a slight angle to best accommodate the screws and other obstructions extending through the keyboard. Leave at least the very edge of the fold out so that it doesn\\'t get creased hard and possibly soon break on its own. You could roll up the flap, too, but it might be harder to store or cover if it is rolled up and under tension to expand than if it is simply bent over.\\n- Folding the membrane into many layers (which will bulge around the folded edges, inside and outside the keyboard enclosure) to tuck into a small space will likely make it too thick and press on the adjacent navigation key switches from underneath. So, you may be left with most of it tucked in and a little sticking out at the keyboard edge. Ignoring that works great.You could cover the cut edge of the keyboard with wide, strong tape such as mailing tape, a hard cover of another material, or even a flat piece of plastic made from the cut-off piece of the bottom cover, tipped upward. If you use tape, and have to remove the tape, carefully free it from the plastic wrap or you may pull that off and have to replace it. If you use part of the bottom cover, you may have to remove or trim down its rim and ribs, and mark its inside edge for cutting by reference to the contour of the edge of the top cover above the bottom cover. After cleaning the mating surfaces, you could attach the plate made from the bottom cover or other rigid material with glue, solvent cement, or strong double-sided tape suitable for the materials involved. If glued or cemented, they would probably have to be held firmly with a device such as a strap clamp until dry. Attaching an improvised cover with a strong adhesive or cement could frustrate opening the keyboard later.'"			True
