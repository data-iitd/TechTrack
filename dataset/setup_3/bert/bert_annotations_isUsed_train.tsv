'Was printer used?'			'2 - Pick between inkjet and laser technology.\nPick between inkjet and laser technology. InkJet has been one of the most popular options for all-in-one printers for the past few years, particularly because they have a much lower upfront cost than laser printers. Inkjet printers also have a reputation for printing higher quality photographs than laser printers. However, inkjet printers are slower than laser printers and they perform poorly when printing something that has a low-quality or low-resolution source. Laser printers are better suited for printing quickly and printing in high volumes, but also tend to be larger in size.\n- If you are only going to print text documents, the laser printer is the better choice. They are fast, low-maintenance, and high quality. While inkjet printers can print at a similar quality, they print slower and require far more maintenance.\n- If you plan on printing in color often, the inkjet printer is the better choice. Unlike black and white printing, color printing on a laser printer requires 4 toners, which can bump up maintenance costs noticeably. On top of that, color laser printers are significantly more expensive upfront.\n- If you plan on printing photographs, the inkjet printer is the better choice. Laser printers are not good at printing on specialty papers, including photo stock, resulting in poor quality photographs. Inkjet printers, on the other hand, print very high quality photographs.'

If you ever plan on scanning an item into your computer, be sure you buy an all-in-one printer with a high quality scanner. Standard scanners often produce images with low quality.

Flatness is when low, medium, and high-pitched sounds all have the same audio quality. Try playing a song that transitions between various pitch levels. If the earphones seem to pick up higher tones much better than lower tones, the music probably won’t sound that great to you. Good earphones maintain a consistent audio quality no matter how high or low a tone is.[8]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Fatness doesn’t mean the music lacks dynamic highs and lows.\n- This test is subjective.

No one enjoys having that buzzing sound in their ears.[9]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- The audio should sound clear no matter what plays. Usually, newer, costlier earphones have less issues with rattling than older, cheaper earphones.\n- Rattling may not be an issue if you don’t listen to a lot of music with low pitches.'			False

Any distortion not only sounds unpleasant, but reminds you you’re wearing earphones.[10]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- If you can, use binaural recordings to test this.
