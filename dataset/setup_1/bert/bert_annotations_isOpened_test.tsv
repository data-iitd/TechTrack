So you create an alias that makes "Ls" behave like "ls".\n- Unix administrators often arrange that all users have the command rm set up as an alias for "rm -i".  This forces the user to type "y" before deleting a file!\n- Make sure that the alias you wish to set up is not already in use.  Use the command "which" to verify that the command is not in use.

Most of these machines only have marginal user accounts because they are rarely accessed(by regular users).  You need to look at many directories (each having many files) and do not want to keep typing "ls -alth | more" (This command is a directory listing command that lists all files, in order of most recent modification and lists the size of the file in human readable form.
