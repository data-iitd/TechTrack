'Was printer used?'			'2 - Pick between inkjet and laser technology.\nPick between inkjet and laser technology. InkJet has been one of the most popular options for all-in-one printers for the past few years, particularly because they have a much lower upfront cost than laser printers. Inkjet printers also have a reputation for printing higher quality photographs than laser printers. However, inkjet printers are slower than laser printers and they perform poorly when printing something that has a low-quality or low-resolution source. Laser printers are better suited for printing quickly and printing in high volumes, but also tend to be larger in size.\n- If you are only going to print text documents, the laser printer is the better choice. They are fast, low-maintenance, and high quality. While inkjet printers can print at a similar quality, they print slower and require far more maintenance.\n- If you plan on printing in color often, the inkjet printer is the better choice. Unlike black and white printing, color printing on a laser printer requires 4 toners, which can bump up maintenance costs noticeably. On top of that, color laser printers are significantly more expensive upfront.\n- If you plan on printing photographs, the inkjet printer is the better choice. Laser printers are not good at printing on specialty papers, including photo stock, resulting in poor quality photographs. Inkjet printers, on the other hand, print very high quality photographs.'

'Was earphone used?'			'0 - Judging Sound Quality'			False
'Was earphone used?'			'1 - Play low-frequency sounds to make sure they are audible.\nPlay low-frequency sounds to make sure they are audible. To test the frequency range of your earphones, you can play a song with a variety of pitches. Listen carefully for the low sounds, such as those from bass guitars or baritone vocals. These tones should sound deep but crisp and rich.[5]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Some earphones can detect frequencies as low as 20 hertz (Hz). Check the packaging for more information.\n- If all headphones seem to have the same frequency issues, your hearing could be the issue.'			False
'Was earphone used?'			'2 - Listen to high frequencies to gauge how well the earphones detect them.\nListen to high frequencies to gauge how well the earphones detect them. Balanced earphones pick up high frequencies as well as low frequencies. High frequencies occur in orchestral arrangements and other music. Try listening to music with high-pitched voices, guitars, piccolos, and other instruments to make sure these tones come through the earphones without distortion.[6]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Good earphones can detect frequencies as high as 20 kHz.\n- Earphones may detect either high or low frequencies better. If this happens, choose earphones that are best for the content you listen to.'			False
'Was earphone used?'			"3 - Adjust the sound volume to hear the dynamic range.\nAdjust the sound volume to hear the dynamic range. To test the dynamic range, change the volume so the audio plays loudly but doesn't make you uncomfortable. The dynamic range indicates how loud and soft the audio can get before you stop hearing it. You should be able to hear the full range of sound clearly at a comfortable volume.[7]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- For instance, if you listen to a lot of podcasts, you may need your earphones to pick up low voices rather than high-pitched instruments."			False
'Was earphone used?'			'4 - Test the earphones for an even sound quality at all pitches.\nTest the earphones for an even sound quality at all pitches.. Flatness is when low, medium, and high-pitched sounds all have the same audio quality. Try playing a song that transitions between various pitch levels. If the earphones seem to pick up higher tones much better than lower tones, the music probably won’t sound that great to you. Good earphones maintain a consistent audio quality no matter how high or low a tone is.[8]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Fatness doesn’t mean the music lacks dynamic highs and lows.\n- This test is subjective. It can change depending on your hearing. Find earphones that work best for you personally.'			True
'Was earphone used?'			'5 - Check the audio for any signs of buzzing or rattling.\nCheck the audio for any signs of buzzing or rattling. Keep the audio at a high but comfortable level and listen closely. You have probably heard unpleasant sounds blasting from a car radio before. Bass-heavy music often sounds unpleasant because the electronics cannot relay the sounds cleanly. No one enjoys having that buzzing sound in their ears.[9]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- The audio should sound clear no matter what plays. Usually, newer, costlier earphones have less issues with rattling than older, cheaper earphones.\n- Rattling may not be an issue if you don’t listen to a lot of music with low pitches.'			False
'Was earphone used?'			'6 - Gauge how realistic the sound is in your ears.\nGauge how realistic the sound is in your ears. The best earphones are immersive, making you feel like you’re at a concert or listening to someone speak in person. For this to happen, the audio needs to be full and rich. Any distortion not only sounds unpleasant, but reminds you you’re wearing earphones.[10]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- If you can, use binaural recordings to test this. These sounds are recorded with microphones placed on the ear, so they are ideal tests of immersion.\n- For example, listen to binaural audio of someone knocking on a door. Ask yourself if it sounds like someone is knocking on a real wooden door right next to you.'			False
