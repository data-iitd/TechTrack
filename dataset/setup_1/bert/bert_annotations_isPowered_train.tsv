'Is keyboard powered on?'			"5 - Open the keyboard.\nOpen the keyboard.  You'll need to remove all the working parts from the space between the number pad and the other keys so that the case can be cut without damaging the insides with less-than-ideally placed or stress-focusing ragged cuts to mechanical parts, or with breaks in electronic circuits.  To do that, you have to open up the keyboard.  Before you take apart something complicated or unintuitive, or once you notice that you have (seeing, for instance, an array of different-length screws), make a reminder of how to put it back together.  Take notes or a digital picture.\n- Turn the keyboard upside down and remove the screws from the back.\n- Sometimes, a plastic case may be held together partly by one or more screws hidden under a sticker.  If so, poke into and slice around the edges of a round depression or lump in it with a small knife, or just poke a screwdriver through.  In an area that would show, gently lift up the edge of the sticker with a knife (a blunt one will often do) and peel it up, lifting more than rolling back so as not to crease it, impart a strong bend that won't go back down, or damage the surface.  If you remove it entirely, set it sticky-side-up out of harm's way until time to replace it.\n- Sometimes a plastic case may be held together by an interlocking tab at an edge. If so, lift out the other edge first or bend one or both mating parts to free it.\n- Sometimes a case may be held together by screws extending from the top into the bottom, such as screws under the spacebar, which pops off, on a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000, or screws under stickers.\n- When you have the bottom free, set the keyboard on a table to complete disassembly so its parts don't dump out before you see how they all fit together."			None
'Is keyboard powered on?'			"6 - Disassemble the keyboard.\nDisassemble the keyboard.  Set the keyboard on a table keys down:  all the parts fit into openings and projections of the top part, with the bottom normally just pressing them into place, so gravity will keep them nestled in the top until you take them out.  Once you can get something out of the outer case, there's no need to disassemble it further.  It's best to take out all of the keys and big, loose items so they don't get broken and the plastic shavings you'll make by cutting the case can be vacuumed away, but anything small and firmly mounted entirely away from the number pad can stay.  You'll notice the following parts, from the now up-facing bottom of the keyboard to the top:\n- Case screws.  You already loosened these to free the bottom cover.  Take them out and set them aside or carefully set the bottom aside with them still in the holes so they don't fall and get lost.\n- Bottom cover.\n- Multi-layer keyboard membrane set of thin, non-stretchy plastic with electrical circuit traces.  Keep this together so that dirt doesn't get between the layers and put it aside.  It's delicate and possibly susceptible to water damage, so don't clean it except to gently wipe off any excess dirt.  Notice that it has holes which fit over pegs in the top cover to keep it from sliding around under the set of keys which is supposed to tap it in particular places to indicate what is being pressed.  If it is held down somehow, remove whatever is holding it down.  Unscrew screws and wiggle it past or cut off any bits of plastic holding it.  Do not cut the membrane itself!  Notice that the keyboard has an electrical connection to some electronics themselves connected to the USB cable.  If those are permanently connected, remove them from the keyboard with the membrane.  If it's removable, check that it can connect only one way or note how it connects.  On the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, the membrane has a set of contacts at an edge that press between a rubber pad in a pocket and a set of contacts on the edge of a rigid printed circuit board that lays over it.[3]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- One or more silicone sheets of dome switches to provide one dome per key.  Notice that the domes face the keys, which would kink them to tap the membrane, and that, like the membrane, they fit over pegs to keep them from sliding around.  They don't themselves contain any electronic parts, so wipe them or even wash them gently if you like, but make sure they are dry before reassembling the keyboard.\n- One or more key assemblies - banks of keys in plastic frames.  On an old keyboard, these probably have lots of dirt that might even interfere with their smooth travel.  Blow it out from between the keys with a small blower or canned air.  Wash them if you like, even in a dishwasher (away from the heating element, which could melt them) but make sure they are dry before reassembling the keyboard.  It's not easy to remove the keys from their plastic carriers and you might break something trying.If the keys of the to-be-removed number pad are mounted in a common assembly with others, such as the navigation keys, remove the keys in the leftmost row of the number pad for room to work in cutting the assembly.  It's best to put the risk of mistakes closest to the keys you don't want, and, depending on the keyboard's design, a plastic rib remaining on the number-pad side will help anchor the truncated key assembly securely in position with the truncated keyboard case.  On the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, a key is best removed by squeezing catches on the back and pushing it through the frame.In some keyboards, such as the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000, the key assemblies may be affixed to the top cover.  It's OK to leave them there, but take extra care to get out the plastic shavings after cutting off the number pad so they don't interfere with the keyboard's operation.\n- Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock indicator lights.  These may be attached to another electronic assembly or, as with the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, rest on contacts on the membrane.  Check the orientation of the assembly and its contacts.  Even if it appears symmetrical at first glance, it may have to go back in a particular orientation.  Note which end faces a particular way on tape attached to the assembly before removing it if there is a risk of confusion.\n- Cord and main circuit board.  On the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, the cord is woven through several small gaps in the top cover to diffuse and relieve strain from pulls on it before leading to the circuit board, which connects to the membrane with an edge connector that rests against the membrane, which in turn is pressed down by a rubber pad.  Set this assembly, and the pad, aside.\n- Spacebar and its separate dome switch.  Some keyboards may not have a separate dome switch or mounting for the space bar, but the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard does.  Take out the dome switch so it doesn't collect plastic shavings (dirt tends to cling to the silicone), and remove the spacebar too.\n- Top cover.  If you've removed everything electronic from it, you can wash it.  You can wash the bottom cover, too."			None

'Is keyboard powered on?'			"8 - Mark the empty keyboard top and bottom covers for cutting.\nMark the empty keyboard top and bottom covers for cutting.  In addition to creating a straight, square profile, take care to preserve the stiffening flanges and ribs near the number pad.[4]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- Wide masking tape is great for marking straight lines: place it on the side to be kept, with its far edge indicating the place to cut.  It stays fairly straight when stretched taut (stretch any tape from the middle of its width, rather than along one edge, to reduce curving) to automatically continue a straight line and may reduce lifting of little bits of plastic, i.e., burring, at the cut edge.On the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, there is a squarish stiffening flange extending inward at the edge of the top cover's hole for the number pad.  Keep this for strength.  Tear off several inches of tape, set the edge of the tape along the edge of this flange (next to, but not into, which you'll cut), and continue the tape forward and back.If you'll use a long, stiff saw to cut the case, you'll just saw across the whole breadth at once and continue down through the bottom cover.  If not, you may need to mark the bottom cover for cutting.  You may not just be able to wrap the tape around, since a varying cross section from one end to the other might cause the tape not to continue straight around.  Use a separate piece of tape lined up with the first at the front and back of the keyboard before the places its path curves.  Or line up the bottom cover marking tape with measurements taken inward from the right edge of the case by a ruled carpenter's square hanging over that edge, matching measurements from given points at the margin of the top-cover tape to the edge of the case to corresponding points at the margin of the bottom-cover tape.  (Because the bottom cover is smaller than the top cover, tucking into it, you can't just measure equal distances inward from the edge of each cover separately).\n- If the keyboard case has stick-on or otherwise removable feet where you will cut, or on the part you will cut off, peel them off and set them aside to leave the adhesive untouched, and stick them at uncushioned corners after you reassemble the keyboard."			None
'Is keyboard powered on?'			"9 - Cut the keyboard case.\nCut the keyboard case.  It's just thin plastic, so pretty much anything will cut it.  But shears would twist and break it.  A sharp, coarse-bladed hacksaw or a backsaw will be best:  lay the blade flat on a flat part of the line to be cut, press and drag it somewhat firmly to start the kerf (take care to start a single distinct cut without marring the surrounding material), and keep the blade vertical as you saw through the top and bottom covers.  No need to press hard once the saw is started in its kerf: push back and forth gently, and let it do the work until the keyboard case just comes apart.If you have only a little saw, you can cut the frame from one end to the other (watch the number-pad left flange and cut next to it).  If you have a hobby rotary tool such as a Dremel, you could follow the tape all the way around.   Wear hand and eye protection, particularly if you are using a hacksaw (whose blade can break), a saw with big teeth, or a small power tool (a big one would be very dangerous).  Protect the work surface with something like scrap wood or an old telephone book.\n- Save the removed pieces.  You might be able to use part of the removed bottom cover, especially if it was cut off perfectly straight, to close up the cut edge of the keyboard.\n- You can use sandpaper to smooth very-rough areas.  But it will create many fine, messy plastic particles.  Don't turn a fairly straight, rough edge into a smooth, wavy edge through uneven sanding if you plan to attach a flat, rigid cover to the cut edge.  A sanding block to hold the paper flat would help avoid this and the gaps it would leave.\n- Unless you're going to glue a rigid plate over the entire cut end, you can gently round the cut corners by stroking a flat file around them a few times for appearance.  Since the rounded profile will look good, but the cut edge won't, keep the file in a vertical plane.  You could use sandpaper on a flat surface or in a sanding block instead of a file.\n- Once you've finished cutting and grinding, remove the tape and open the keyboard case again so you can clean out the shavings."

On the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, the number pad is part of the same bank of keys as the navigation keys, which you'll need to keep.  There is a rib at the left edge of the number pad.  Keep this, and cut immediately to the right of it:  it adds strength and rests against the top-cover flange that was at the left of the number pad to keep the key assembly from slipping left.

If the number pad keys are part of a larger assembly, the dome switches probably are part of a larger sheet.  They're held in place under the keys by being squeezed at the edges, and their sheet is soft and probably translucently inconspicuous, so it's best to leave a fraction of an inch (cm) margin beyond what is needed than to leave too little.  Be sure to only cut off the number key switches, not the navigation key switches, and trim close to the switches to be removed rather than close to the ones to keep.  Use a single cut with a paper cutter or a full-size scissors to avoid jagged edges that can focus tension and tear."			None

Line up all of the the dome switches' and membrane's retention holes.  Screw on the back cover.  Put on any rubber feet you removed and, after the keyboard is working and this project is otherwise finished, replace any stickers you removed.

'Is keyboard powered on?'			'16 - Tuck away the number pad\'s part of the membrane.\nTuck away the number pad\'s part of the membrane.  You have a few options for this flap:\n- Wrap it underneath the bottom edge of the keyboard and hold its edge in place with cellophane tape.  This is quick and easy.  But it looks sloppy.  It leaves the membrane vulnerable to contamination, especially from spills--though those aren\'t much of a risk in a dedicated keyboard drawer.  It leaves the keyboard unsuitable for placement on surfaces that might press on the membrane and thereby register keystrokes, such as the user\'s lap.  If the keyboard erroneously registers keystrokes from the flap, try shielding one of its layers from the other with plastic wrap.  You could still tuck it under, rather than into, the keyboard.  In that case, don\'t put plastic wrap over the spot the tape is to attach.\n- Prevent it from registering keystrokes by separating its two outer layers from one another and other surfaces with plastic wrap, then tuck it back into the keyboard.  This looks much better, and protects the flap from the environment.  But it risks damaging the membrane and thus killing the keyboard by bending and breaking it or flaking off its circuit traces, either immediately or over time.  It also risks mechanical and electrical interference with the keys it\'s tucked under, usually the navigation keys.To do this, cut a strip of plastic wrap a little longer than the length of the protruding membrane flap (which, with standard plastic-wrap width of 12"/30cm or so, will be much wider).  Draw the plastic wrap around the bottom layer of the membrane flap, which needs to be separated not only from the top flap but from the bottom flap area nearby inside the keyboard case which it will be bent up against.  Pair up the cut edges at the right edge and the top or bottom edge of the plastic wrap (whichever isn\'t wrapped) and press them together so they cling.  Keep the plastic wrap only one layer thick and trim off any great excess extending past the membrane layer edge.  A 1/2 inch (1 cm) margin is plenty.You could try plastic tape instead of plastic wrap.  It would stay in place readily.  But attempting to remove it, as you might want to try if something doesn\'t work initially, could damage the circuit traces--possibly invisibly--and kill the keyboard.Turn the keyboard over and loosen the screws holding the number-pad side of it together, and if necessary the others, so that the cut edge of the keyboard can loosen by a small fraction of an inch (a few mm).  Bend over the membrane flap, all layers together, and tuck it in under the navigation keys\' adjacent membrane.  You may have to tuck the membrane flap in at a slight angle to best accommodate the screws and other obstructions extending through the keyboard.  Leave at least the very edge of the fold out so that it doesn\'t get creased hard and possibly soon break on its own.  You could roll up the flap, too, but it might be harder to store or cover if it is rolled up and under tension to expand than if it is simply bent over.\n- Folding the membrane into many layers (which will bulge around the folded edges, inside and outside the keyboard enclosure) to tuck into a small space will likely make it too thick and press on the adjacent navigation key switches from underneath.  So, you may be left with most of it tucked in and a little sticking out at the keyboard edge.  Ignoring that works great.You could cover the cut edge of the keyboard with wide, strong tape such as mailing tape, a hard cover of another material, or even a flat piece of plastic made from the cut-off piece of the bottom cover, tipped upward.  If you use tape, and have to remove the tape, carefully free it from the plastic wrap or you may pull that off and have to replace it.  If you use part of the bottom cover, you may have to remove or trim down its rim and ribs, and mark its inside edge for cutting by reference to the contour of the edge of the top cover above the bottom cover.  After cleaning the mating surfaces, you could attach the plate made from the bottom cover or other rigid material with glue, solvent cement, or strong double-sided tape suitable for the materials involved.  If glued or cemented, they would probably have to be held firmly with a device such as a strap clamp until dry.  Attaching an improvised cover with a strong adhesive or cement could frustrate opening the keyboard later.'			None

Sometimes, the loose wire isn’t in one of the earbuds, but in the jack that plugs into your phone, laptop, or car stereo. In this case, you’ll need to remove the protective plastic barrel and peel back the rubber coating in order to expose the wires underneath. With the barrel out of the way, you’ll be able to apply solder freely as needed.[9]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- Some headphone jacks have barrels that screw off.

Now that the faulty solder is out of the way, reattach the loose wire to its terminal and press a length of .032-diameter electronics solder into the joint. Heat the solder with your soldering iron to melt it and resecure the wire. Proceed to solder each broken wire.[12]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- If both wires are broken, you can reconnect them to either of the terminals on the circuit board.\n- It may help to use a table clamp or pair of pliers to hold the cord and earbud together while you’re working.'

'Is earbud powered on?'			'7 - Reconnect each colored wire to its respective terminal to fix the jack.\nReconnect each colored wire to its respective terminal to fix the jack. When soldering split wires at the jack, it’s important to first make sure they’re running to the right terminals. On most pairs of earbuds, the copper wire should go to the large central terminal, the red wire to the smaller righthand terminal, and the green wire to the left.[13]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Connecting the wires to the wrong terminals could fail to solve the problem.\n- If you had to cut off the jack to uncover the broken wires, purchase a replacement jack and solder the wires to the color-coded terminals as described in the included instructions.[14]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- On some replacement jacks, you can simply wind the broken wire through the small hole in the terminal a few times rather than soldering it on.[15]\n- X\n- Research source'			None

Happy listening!\n- If you’re still not getting any sound, it may be because the solder didn’t hold, or you’ve accidentally run the colored wires to the wrong terminals. You have to try again in order to correct your mistake.\n- It's hard to justify the difficulty and expense of repairing shorts in the middle of the cord.

Balanced earphones pick up high frequencies as well as low frequencies. High frequencies occur in orchestral arrangements and other music. Try listening to music with high-pitched voices, guitars, piccolos, and other instruments to make sure these tones come through the earphones without distortion.[6]\n- X\n- Research source\n- \n- \n- Good earphones can detect frequencies as high as 20 kHz.\n- Earphones may detect either high or low frequencies better.
