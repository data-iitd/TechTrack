Unless you have significant electronics repair experience, take your monitor to a professional repair service.\n- Other signs of a blown capacitor include a loud humming noise, lines across the screen, and multiple images.\n- The power supply unit is one of the most expensive components in the monitor.

Hire a professional to install it.\n- The panel serial number should be displayed somewhere on the device, usually on the back.

If your problem is not described above, or if the monitor still won't work after the attempted fix, consider these issues as well:\n- If the picture responds to input but displays a messy image, such as jumbled multicolored squares, the AV (audio visual) board may be damaged. This is usually a rectangular circuit board located near the audio and visual cables. Replace obviously damaged parts using a soldering iron, or order a replacement board and carefully install it to the same screws and ribbon cables.\n- The main control buttons may be faulty. Clean them with a metal cleaner, or jostle to attach a loose connection. If necessary, locate the circuit board they are attached to and re-solder any broken connections.\n- Check input cables for damage, or try other cables of the same type.
